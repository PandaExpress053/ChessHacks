{ A great part of this chapter is devoted to King + Pawn vs. King endings. Most players handle these endings with confidence, but some have trouble in less common positions. Very often the problem lies in the overuse of the theory of the opposition. While opposition is a very useful concept and its best field of application is Pawn endings, its value is sometimes overestimated.

King + Pawn vs. King endings are best explained by means of the key squares theory, using opposition at the right time and adapting its value to each situation. I assume the reader knows the basic mates and the Bishop + Wrong Rook's Pawn ending. In any case, a perfect demonstration of these endings can be found in many books.

{ The first question we have to answer in King + Pawn vs. King endings is this: Can the pawn promote without the aid of the king?

Calculating the race between the pawn and the enemy king is enough to answer this question. This calculation is not complicated but, anyway, experience has taught us a simple way to solve the problem at a glance: the so-called 'rule of the square'. This rule helps us calculate and can be applied to any other endgame which presents the same race situation.

Now we are ready to state the main rule.
"Rule of the square: If the king can reach the square of the pawn, then he can capture the pawn; if not, the pawn promotes."
If, when recalling the rule, we doubt whether the king must reach the square with his move or he must already be inside, we shall observe this: if the king chased the pawn from the rear (in this example it might be from b3), should he be inside the square before moving? Of course not: therefore, it would be the same if the king came from farther away, be it from the pawn's rear or from its side. } { [%csl Ga4][%cal Ga4a5] } 2. a5 { It is clear that, in this case, the enemy king has not reached the square of the pawn, so White wins. } { [%csl Yd5,Yd8,Ya8,Ya5][%cal Ya5d5,Yd5d8,Yd8a8,Ya5a8,Ya5d8] } 2...

{ Blocking the way and supporting the pawn with the king.
Let us now look at Position 1.3. The black king has clearly reached the square. Now the pawn can promote only with the aid of the king. The easiest way is by blocking the enemy king's way.

This concept of blocking appears very often in pawn endings, but also in many others, and it is at the core of Rook vs. Pawn endings.

We can now state the second rule, which works with almost all pawns, the exception being the rook's pawn.
When possible, the stronger side's king will prevent its rival from standing in front of the pawn. If he succeeds, the pawn promotes. } { [%csl Gc6][%cal Gc6c7] }

{ Opposition

We have just seen what happens in the two simplest cases:

1 - When the king does not support the pawn.

2 - When the king supports the pawn by preventing the enemy king from standing in its way.

However, the most interesting situation in a King + Pawn vs. King ending occurs when the defending king occupies a key square in front of the pawn. Then, everything depends on the relative position of the kings.

The first important position, which we must fix in our minds, occurs when the pawn has reached the 6th rank and is only two steps away from the promotion square. Despite the proximity of the 8th rank, we will need to examine some positions before we grasp all the important details. In Position 1.4, the pawn can take its two last steps almost automatically. } { [%csl Gf6][%cal Gf6f7] }

{ However, the result changes completely if in Position 1.4 it is Black's turn. The reason is that the pawn cannot promote if both kings are opposed when the pawn reaches the 7th rank. Then we say that they are in opposition, like here after Black's first move:

1... ♔g8 ! } { [%csl Gf8][%cal Gf8g8] }
1... Kg8 { Now the kings are opposed and in this situation, almost always, the side that has the opposition has the advantage, and the side to move is at a disadvantage.
As stated above, opposition has gained an excessive prestige; in some cases it is not so useful. If we want to make the most of it, and not to let it deceive us, we just have to notice how it suits us in each case.
"In a King + Pawn vs. King ending, king opposition is decisive when the pawn is on the 6th rank."
This is the first important pattern we must recognise. } { [%csl Rg6][%cal Gg8g6,Gg6g8] } 2. f7+ { Here the pawn moves ahead but cannot promote. Anyway, other moves would not win against an accurate defence. For instance:
2.Kg5Kf7 !
2...Kf8 is also good
The safest way for the defender is to stay on the two squares available in front of the pawn. This fortress cannot be broken. If you have not done this before, it is worth observing and analysing this simple sequence3.Kf5 Kf8 ! (staying in front of the pawn is always the simplest way) 4.Kf4 Kf7 !5.Kf5 Kf8 6.Ke6 (if the defending king has always waited in front of the pawn, it is possible to get the opposition now that the enemy king must retreat from that file)6...Ke8! 7.f7+ Kf8 8.Kf6 stalemate, as in the main line. } { [%cal Gg8f8] } 2... Kf8 { In contrast with Position 1.4, White is to move and to prevent the loss of the pawn, he must stalemate Black’s king. } 3. Kf6 { and draw by stalemate.
In this ending we have seen that, if the defending king takes the opposition when the pawn is on the 6th rank, the pawn cannot promote. If we go deeper, we also see that the major obstacle for the white king has been his own pawn. Therefore, we can conclude that:
1) The stronger side must not push the pawn too quickly.
2) The pawn should only reach the 6th rank in one of these two scenarios: a) its path to promotion is clear, or b) its advance causes the kings to be opposed (but usually this only happens when the king has reached the 6th rank before the pawn)
Let us have a look at two more positions to consolidate some ideas related to the 6th-rank opposition. Then, our next positions will focus on how to manoeuvre before the pawn reaches the 6th rank. } { [%csl Rf6,Bg7,Bf7,Be7,Gf8] } *

{ --Losing the opposition --
Most mistakes made in King + Pawn vs. King endings occur in this position. The reason is that this situation is just provisional: the black king cannot keep the opposition because the pawn controls the f7-square. As stated above, the best squares for the lone king are those in front of the pawn. Otherwise, he may not get there in the right circumstances. This occurs in the next example, which is also important to find out why opposition is sometimes useless. Black loses, no matter who has the move. If Black is to move, the white king will immediately take the opposition on the 6th rank; if White is to move ...

Let us have a look at the position: It is White's turn and he cannot take the opposition, while we know that if the king moves in front of the pawn he will have to retreat from his blocking position on his next move.

{ When the pawn has not reached the 6th rank yet, the analysis grows in complexity, but there are very clear rules. If we know them, we will play the ending with accuracy and we will quickly know whether the pawn promotes or not. The essential concept here is that of key squares. But what are key squares and what is their effect?

"If the strong king occupies one of the key squares, the pawn promotes. When the pawn is on the 5th rank, its key squares are those three in front ( e6, f6 and g6, marked in the diagram )."

Since the king has reached one of them, White wins:
1. ♔f6! } { [%csl Re6,Rf6,Rg6][%cal Ge6f6] }
1. Kf6 { Of course not
1.f6 ?? Ke8!

Kf6 would have led to the same position; if on f6, White wins with
1.Ke6 Ke8 2.f6, taking the opposition in the key situation: when the pawn reaches the 6th rank. Were it Black's turn in any of the three examples, White would win by means of one of those two manoeuvres: either supporting the pawn from the 7th rank or taking the opposition.
Therefore, we have seen that White wins if his king reaches any key square. That will condition our previous play. } *

{ #Key squares when the pawn has not reached the 5th rank.

"If the pawn has not reached the 5th rank, its key squares are two ranks ahead."

For example, for a pawn on the 4th rank, the key squares are on the 6th rank; in the diagram, c6, d6 and e6. But the rule still applies: if the white king occupies one, the pawn promotes. The key squares for a pawn on the 5th rank are the same as on the 4th rank. For a pawn on the 2nd or 3rd rank that rule (the key squares are two ranks ahead) is still valid. That is, for a d3 pawn, the key squares would be e5, d5 and c5; for a d2 pawn, e4, d4 and c4.

In the diagram position, the white king easily reaches one of the key squares, but sometimes opposition plays a role, causing the fight for the squares to be harder.

{ ## The distant opposition ##
In the diagram position the fight for the key squares is tougher. We already know that, for a 4th-rank pawn, the key squares are two ranks ahead; in this case, b3, c3 and d3 (marked in the diagram) .

We also know that opposition prevents the enemy king from going further, so if the strong king reaches the 4th rank and then his counterpart takes the opposition from the 2nd rank, the former will not make progress or occupy the key squares. However, if the white king moves to the 2nd rank, it is Black who takes the opposition. What to do then ? Sometimes we can succeed thanks to the so-called distant opposition.

1. ♔b1! } { [%csl Yb3,Yd3,Yc3][%cal Ga1b1] }
1. Kb1 { When both kings are on the same file separated by an odd number of squares (3 or 5), we talk about distant opposition. This is an effective way to restrict the enemy king's progress. For example, in this case the black king can gain a rank, but no more, as then his white counterpart will oppose him, taking the direct opposition. Thus the white king prevents him from advancing two ranks and getting to the key squares.
It is interesting to note that Black cannot win, even if it were again White's turn. Distant opposition can be lost, the same as direct opposition (see Position 1.7), if some squares are out of reach. Now White would play Kc1 and Black would lose the opposition because ... Kc5 is impossible. } { [%csl Gb1,Bb5,Yb3,Yc3,Yd3] } 1... Kb4 { If 1...Kc4, then 2.Kc2, always taking the opposition and hindering progress. } { [%csl Gb1][%cal Gb1b2] } 2.

{ ## Using reserve moves ##
Remember that the key squares for a 3rd-rank pawn are two ranks ahead. Thus, here the key squares are f5, g5 and h5. The white king is already there, so White should win, but how to outflank the opposing king?

This is possible thanks to a reserve move with the pawn.

{ So far, everything we have said is valid for all pawns with the exception of the rook's pawn, which deserves special attention.

In a pawn ending, the rook's pawn is the most difficult to promote. It requires its path to be clear. The reason is the possibility of a stalemate when the pawn reaches the 7th rank supported by the king, no matter from where. This new situation renders useless all our rules about the range, the opposition and the key squares stated in the previous endings.

In this position it doesn't matter who is to move: this is always a draw.
1. ♔h1 } { [%csl Gg1][%cal Gg1h1] }
1. Kh1 { White loses the opposition, but no matter: there is a stalemate. } 1... h2 { Stalemate.
Conclusion: With a rook's pawn, if the defender's king stands on the way, it is a draw. } *

{ ### Quantity is not quality ###

Though we are studying single-pawn endings, exceptionally I will show you this diagram-an imaginary position, it cannot be reached in an actual game! - to illustrate the idea that there is little hope of promoting a rook's pawn.

We can see here that if the defending king stands in the pawn's path, not even 6 rook's pawns are enough to win. }

{ Unfortunately for the strong side, standing in the pawn's path is not the only way for the defender to draw this ending. The vicinity of the edge of the board can also dramatically restrict the mobility of the stronger side's king.

This is so clear that we could add many doubled rook's pawns to the diagram and still Black could not win.
Conclusion: In order to draw against a rook's pawn, placing the King in front of the pawn is enough, but occupying one of the two nearest squares on the bishop's file also works. In this example, the c1 and c2-squares. } *

{ When fighting against a rook, the knight may have more trouble than the bishop. Nevertheless, most positions are drawn. In this ending, keeping the knight close to the king is the best policy. If the knight is separated from the king, it can be lost.

No problems for White, though both the king and the knight have been driven to the edge of the board. Not so when they are in the corner. Moreover, this position has great theoretical importance, as it usually occurs as a result of a Rook vs. Pawn endgame, as we will see in the corresponding section.

When the knight and the king are together on the edge, moves are usually forced, but then there is a lower risk of blundering. The knight should not be separated from the king in any circumstances, though this does not necessarily imply an automatic defeat. The first move is clearly forced.

{ Things are radically different when the king and the knight are at one corner of the board, no matter who occupies the corner-square. Their mobility is then restricted and the position becomes immediately lost. Even if the knight occupies the g2-square (an especially unfortunate square for the knight) most cases result in a defeat.

There is no need for a deep analysis and it does not matter which side is to move: in all these positions (1.21, 1.22 and 1.23) White loses the knight straight away.

The third diagram is specially impressive: the knight is not even on the edge of the board, but it is lost anyway. This is our first example of a 'knight's dumb square' and its effects, but it will not be the last.
Conclusion: In the battle Knight vs. Rook there are two scenarios the defender should avoid:
1) The knight is separated from the king
2) Both pieces are trapped in the corner ( even if the knight is on the g2-square ) . }

{ I have presented here a Rook vs. Knight ending because the basic ideas are 1 simple and 2 a must for all players.

It is true, though, that the trapping phase can sometimes be complicated. Also, some positions with the king and the knight on the edge require an accurate defence, although those cases follow the general rule that the defender only loses if one of the pieces is in the corner. }
1. Kg3 { When I was rounding off this book, two top players played a surprising endgame whose result amazed everyone who likes studying chess (or so I thought) . It is a remarkable ending, because it contains the ideas shown in the previous two endings and illustrates the difficulties of certain positions when the king and the knight are on the edge. } 1... Nd3 { Therefore, I thought it was worth including it here although, due to its complexity, I do not recommend learning it by heart, like the previous ones. I will not comment in detail on all possible lines for the same reason. } 2. Rd2 { Bacrot had reached this position after an accurate defence of first a Rook + Pawn vs. Rook+ Pawn, and then a Rook+ Pawn vs. Rook ending (see Question 28 in the Final Test) . He has just promoted to a knight, which, as we shall see in Ending 23, is the standard way of saving these positions. Now he has a supposedly well known drawn ending. } 2... Ne1 { I assumed that at this point he relaxed, and he was probably in time trouble.
Nevertheless, there is a special circumstance, which is interesting for us from a theoretical point of view: the knight is 'within range' of its dumb square
g2
and the king is placed on the knight's side next to that square. Defending this ending is somewhat difficult } 3. Rf2+ Kg1 4. Rf8 { So far everything has been forced. Now Black's troubles start. The knight must go to the dumb square or move away from the king. } 4... Ng2 5. Kf3 Kf1 { Actually, this is the losing move. That should not be surprising: with the knight on the g2-square, the defender is very likely to lose. The correct defence, not easy to find, was
