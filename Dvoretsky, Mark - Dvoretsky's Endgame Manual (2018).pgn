{ My cooperation and friendship with Mark Dvoretsky has already lasted almost 30 years. He was more than just a coach or second. He was my most important chess teacher. I owe my greatest victories to him and we are still in contact with each other quite often.  Mark has developed a method that can catapult a talented player from Elo 2200 to grandmaster level in 4 to 5 years. An important part of this procedure is the study of the endgame. Mark firmly believes that endgame technique is of universal value.  He recognized this when he prepared several endgame sessions for the education of prospective Russian chess trainers. At first he thought that the job was routine work, only requiring him to write down what he already knew. But suddenly he realized that he was playing better!  I also believe in the interactive effect of endgame study. It makes it easier to judge and use the potential of the pieces and to understand their interaction.  So not only our endgame technique, but also our intuition and positional understanding are refined. In the endgame, plans must be found all the time – so it sharpens our strategic eye as well.  So I was very happy when Mark told me two years ago, that he was planning to write an endgame manual. Now this work by one of the world’s leading endgame specialists has appeared and you can enjoy the fruits of his labor. I am sure that those who study this work carefully will not only play the endgame better, but overall, their play will improve. One of the secrets of the Russian chess school is now before you, dear reader!  International Grandmaster Artur Yusupov  Weissenhorn, September 2003 }

{ The first time I heard about the book you are now holding in your hands was in the summer of 2000, when Mark Dvoretsky was giving lectures in Copenhagen for a group of the best Danish players.  I had only just been able to put my jaw back in place after being rushed through a rook ending I was badly prepared to understand. What had fascinated me most was not that rook endings could be explained the way Mark explained them, but that the simplicity of dicta like the rook should always be active had such far reaching practical implications.  Hey, I can actually understand this! was the thought running through my head. The game Flohr-Vidmar, Nottingham 1936  (in Rook Endgames)  especially impressed me. Mark then told us that he was indeed working on a new book on the endgame, a comprehensive manual which would be finished within a year.  In fact it took far more than a year, and to be honest, I am not really sure that Mark will ever finish his work with this book – or that he should. In the summer of 2002 the German version, titled Die Endspieluniversität, was published. And I am the proud owner of the first ever signed copy of the book I called The best chess book ever written in a 10-page review in the Swedish chess magazine Schacknytt.  Since the book was released  (and I wrote my review)  I have worked with it, in both my own training and my work with juniors, and I have come to the following conclusion: Going through this book will certainly improve your endgame knowledge, but just as important, it will also greatly improve your ability to calculate variations. In particular, the section on pawn endings has convinced me that solving studies and pawn endings should be an important part of my pre-tournament training  (and when am I not preparing for the next tournament?)  . So the book is practical indeed, more so than any other book in my extensive library.  But there is another point, just as important, regarding the general sense of aesthetics in the book. The studies, both those selected and those created by the author himself, are not just instructive, but some of the finest studies I have ever seen.  But what really impresses me is the deep level of analysis in the book. Rules and techniques are important for the practical player in the development of ability, but if the analysis is less than thorough, it is hard to really get into the text. Improvements have been found to the analysis of the German edition and incorporated into the English edition and Mark is always ready to discuss and improve his analysis with anyone. He understands fully that a book has a life and rights of its own. Greatness is possible, but perfection may not be. I must admit that I personally feel as if Shakespeare asked me to write a foreword to Hamlet, and yes, I must admit that I suffer from a lot of confusion as to why he did this. All I can say is: This is a great book. I hope it will bring you as much pleasure as it has me.  International Grandmaster Jacob Aagaard  Copenhagen, September 2003 }

{ Endgame theory is not a complicated subject to study!  All one needs is thorough knowledge of a limited number of “precise” positions  (as a rule, elementary ones)  plus some of the most important principles, evaluations, and standard techniques. The question is, how to select the most important material from the thousands of endings analyzed in various handbooks?  That is why this book was written: it offers the basic information you need as the foundation of your own personal endgame theory.  As long ago as 1970, when I was just a young chess master and a student at Moscow University, I was unexpectedly invited to give some endgame lectures to the chess faculty of the Moscow High School for Sports. It was then that I had to think about what exactly a practical chess player must study. I defined sound methods of studying endgame theory  (from the point of view of logic, rather obvious ones)  and prepared examples of the most important types of endgames  (pawn, rook-and-pawn endgames, and those with opposite-color bishops)  . I also prepared a series of lectures on the general principles of endgame play. By the way, the main ideas of that series became  (with my permission)  the basis of the popular book Endgame Strategy by Mikhail Shereshevsky  (I recommend that book to my readers)  .  Later on, these materials, continually corrected and enlarged, were used in teaching numerous apprentices. They proved to be universal and useful for players of widely different levels: from ordinary amateurs to the world’s leading grandmasters. My work with grandmasters, some of them belonging to the world’s Top Ten, have convinced me that almost none of them had studied chess endings systematically.They either did not know or did not remember many important endgame positions and ideas, which can be absorbed even by those of relatively modest chess experience. As a result, even among grandmasters, grave errors occur even in elementary situations: you will find plenty of examples in this book. Some grandmasters asked me to help them, and our studies resulted usually in a substantial improvement of their tournament achievements. Two weeks of intensive study were usually more than enough to eliminate the gaps in their endgame education.  So, what will you find in this book?  Precise positions. This is our term for concrete positions – positions with a minimum number of pawns, which should be memorized and which will serve as guideposts again and again in your games.  The hardest part of preparing this book was deciding which positions to include and which to leave out. This required rejection of many examples that were intrinsically interesting and even instructive, but of little practical value. Common sense dictates that effort should be commensurate to the expected benefit. Human memory is limited, so there is no sense in filling it up with rarely-seen positions that will probably never occur in our actual games. One should study relatively few positions, the most important and most probable, but study and understand them perfectly. One should not remember long and perplexing analyses. We may never have an opportunity to reproduce them in our games, and we will certainly forget them sooner or later. Our basic theoretical knowledge must be easy to remember and comprehend. Some complicated positions are also important, but we may absorb their general evaluations and basic ideas, plus perhaps a few of their most important lines only.  The positions that I consider part of the basic endgame knowledge system are shown by diagrams and comments in blue print. If the explanatory notes are too complicated or less important the print is black; these positions are also useful but there is not much sense in committing them to memory.  Endgame ideas. These represent, of course, the most significant part of endgame theory. Study of certain endgame types can be almost fully reduced to absorbing ideas  (general principles, standard methods and evaluations)  rather than to memorizing precise positions.  When discussing precise positions, we will certainly point out the endgame ideas in them. But many standard ideas transcend any particular precise position. These ideas should be absorbed with the help of schemata – very simple positions where a technique or a tool works in a distilled form and our attention is not distracted by any analysis of side lines. Over the course of time we may forget the precise shape of a schema but will still remember the technique. Another method of absorbing endgame ideas is to study practical games or compositions where the ideas have occurred in the most attractive form.  The schemata and the most instructive endgames are represented by color diagrams as well. Plus, important rules, recommendations and names of the important tools are given in bold italics.  As I am sure you realize, the choice of the ideas and precise positions included in this system of basic endgame knowledge is, to some extent, a subjective matter. Other authors might have made slightly different choices. Nevertheless I strongly recommend that you not ignore the blue text: it is very important. However you of course are free to examine it critically, and to enrich it with the other ideas in this book  (those in black print)  , as well as with examples you already know, from other books or your own games.  Retention of the material. This book would have been rather thin if it included only a laconic list of positions and ideas related to the obligatory minimum of endgame knowledge. As you see, this is not so.  Firstly, the notes are definitely not laconic, after all, this is a manual, not a handbook. In a handbook, a solution of a position is all one needs; in a manual, it should be explained how one can discover the correct solution, which ideas are involved.  Secondly, in chess  (as in any other sphere of human activity)  , a confident retention of theory cannot be accomplished solely by looking at one example: one must also get some practical training with it. For this purpose, additional examples  (those with black diagrams and print)  will be helpful.  You will see instructive examples where the basic theoretical knowledge you have just studied is applied in a practical situation. The connection between the theory and the practical case will not always be direct and obvious. It is not always easy to notice familiar theoretical shapes in a complicated position, and to determine which ideas should be applied in this concrete case. On the other hand, a position may resemble theory very much but some unobvious details exist; one should discover them and find how this difference influences the course of the fight and its final outcome.  Some practical endings are introduced by the “Tragicomedy” heading. These are examples of grave errors committed by various players  (sometimes extremely strong ones)  . The point is not to laugh at them: you know that there are spots even on the sun. These cases are simply excellent warnings against ignoring endgame theory. Additionally, experience shows that these cases tend to be very well remembered by the student, and are therefore very helpful in absorbing and retaining endgame ideas.  Practical training, by which I mean solving appropriate exercises, is essential. You will find a large number and wide variety of exercises in this book, from easy to very difficult. Some solutions are given directly after the exercises, other are placed in the special chapter that concludes the book.  Some exercises do not involve a search for a single correct solution. They are designed for solving in the playing mode, when a series of contingent decisions is required. The best result can be achieved if a friend or coach assists you by referring to the book. But you can also play through the example without assistance, choosing moves for one side and taking the answering moves from the text of the book.  Of course, one need not study all these examples, nor must one solve all the exercises. But still, if you do, your knowledge of the basic theory will be more sound and reliable. Also, self-training develops one’s ability to calculate lines deeply and precisely; this skill is essential for every player.  Analyses. When working on the manuscript, in addition to the large volume of material I had collected myself, I also – quite naturally – used endgame books by other authors. Checking their analyses, I found that an amazingly high number of endings, including many widely known and used in book after book, are analyzed badly and evaluated wrongly. In those cases I went deeper than the concept of the endgame manual required. I felt I had to do it. As I wrote above, studying endgame theory is not a very labor-intensive process, but analysis of a particular endgame, or practical play under time restriction in a tournament, can be a much more sophisticated and complicated matter. Therefore, my readers will find corrected versions of many interesting endgame analyses, plus some entirely new analyses that are important for endgame theory.  Presentation of the material. The material here is presented mainly in a traditional manner, classified according to the material relationships on the board. First pawn endings are analyzed, then those with minor pieces, then rook-and-pawn, etc. But this method is not followed too strictly. For example, the queen-versus pawns section is in chapter 1, to demonstrate immediately what can arise in some sharp pawn endings.  In the chapter on pawn endings, you will meet some terms and techniques  (such as “corresponding squares,” “breakthrough,” “shouldering” etc.)  that are important for many kinds of endgame. Some of these Dvoretsky’s Endgame Manual techniques are illustrated by additional examples with more pieces on the board; as the book continues, we may refer to these cases again.  Some chapters  (for example, those on pawn and rook-and-pawn endings)  are quite long while others are rather short. Chapter length does not reflect the relative importance of a kind of endgame; rather it has to do with the richness of ideas and number of precise positions required for full understanding.  The final chapter deals with the most general principles, rules and methods of endgame play, such as king’s activity, zugzwang, the fortress etc. Of course, these themes appear earlier in the book, but a review of already familiar ideas improves both understanding and retention.  What this book does not contain. Obviously, one cannot embrace the infinite. I have already described how the book’s material has been selected. Now about other limitations.  My own formal definition of “endgame” is: the stage of a chess game when at least one side has no more than one piece  (in addition to the king)  . Positions with more pieces are not discussed here  (except for cases when the “extra” pieces are exchanged)  .  Our subject is endgame theory. Some problems of chess psychology that belong to “general endgame techniques” are beyond our discussion. Interested readers may turn to the aforementioned Endgame Strategy by Shereshevsky, or to Technique for the Tournament Player, a book by this writer and Yusupov.  Special signs and symbols. The role of the blue text in this book has already been explained. Now the time has come to explain special signs and symbols.  To the left of diagrams, you will find important information. First of all, the indication of who is on move: “W” means White and “B” Black.  If a question mark is shown, the position can be used as an exercise. Most often, there is no special explanation of what is expected from the reader – he must make a correct decision on his own, because in an actual game nobody will tell you whether you should play for a draw or for a win, calculate a lot or simply make a natural move. Sometimes, however, a certain hint is included in a verbal question.  Exercises with solutions that are given separately, at the end of the book, have two sets of numbers beside the diagrams. For example, diagram 1-14, the 14th diagram of chapter 1, also has the designation the information given in the 1/1, meaning it is the first such exercise of chapter 1.  The combination “B/Play” means that the position is designed for replaying, and that you are to take the black pieces.  Beside some black diagrams, the symbol “$” appears. This indicates that the position and the idea behind it have theoretical value, though less compared to those from basic theory  (blue diagrams)  .  Many years ago, the publication Chess Informant developed a system of symbols to describe the evaluation of a position or move. This system is widely used now and, with minimal changes, is applied in this book, too.  Finally, a work of this scope cannot be produced by a single individual. I am grateful to many others for their assistance during the many stages of producing this book. I would like to thank Artur Yusupov and Jacob Aagaard for their encouragement and eventual contributions, the Introduction and Preface respectively; Karsten Müller for his help proof-reading the text and checking the accuracy of variations; Taylor Kingston for his assistance editing the final version of the text; Jim Marfia and Valery Murakhveri for their translations of the original Russian text; Harold van der Heijden for his assistance checking sources; and Hanon Russell, the publisher, for coordinating the efforts of all concerned.  This book is an improved and expanded version of the German-language edition, and in that regard, it is also appropriate to thank Ulrich Dirr, who provided invaluable assistance in the preparation of the German edition and Jürgen Daniel, its publisher. Without their fine work, it would have been significantly more difficult to bring out this English-language edition.  Mark Dvoretsky  Moscow  September 2003 }

{ An author usually has a hard time predicting whether his book will be popular; in this case, however, I was confident that Dvoretsky’s Endgame Manual would be a success. And it was, as witnessed by the almost uniformly favorable  (and in some cases – ecstatic)  reviews and the rapidly sold-out first edition.  Now, only two years later, it is time to prepare a second edition.  The theory of the endgame is constantly evolving – although not, of course, as fast as opening theory.  New instructive endgames are constantly being played and then analyzed; commentaries on endgames played earlier are corrected – in large measure, thanks to the use of rapidly improving computer programs.  On the other hand, if we understand endgame theory, not as the mechanical accumulation of all the information we have, but as the results of our consideration of it, then the authors of endgame books  (as opposed to the authors of opening books)  have no need to be continuously expanding and reworking their texts, since very few new analyses have any practical value in forcing us to reexamine our approaches to the study and play of endgames.  In the past two years, very important discoveries have been made in the theory of one particular area of rook endgames – and I have completely reworked the corresponding chapter of this book. However, there have also been a number of corrections made in other chapters as well – perhaps not as fundamental, and some that are barely noticeable. A few of them involve corrections to the names of players and composers; but most of them, of course, are analytical. And here, the letters from readers to the author and to the publisher, Hanon Russell, have been most valuable. I am truly grateful to everyone who has written to us.  All these notes have been considered in the preparation of the new edition – as a result, a number of new names now appear in the index of composers and analysts. Special thanks are due to that exacting aficionado of the endgame, Karsten Müller, who helped me eradicate of a number of inaccuracies and outright errors in the original text, just as he did with the preparation of the first edition.

{ It is with a great sense of pride that we present the third edition of Dvoretsky’s Endgame Manual by Mark Dvoretsky. When it was first released in 2003, it was embraced by the chess world. Since then, it has set the standard by which all other works on the endgame are measured.  From the outset, the author’s comprehensive coverage of this critical phase of the game has been both staggering in its depth and impressive in its accuracy. However, rather than rest on his laurels, Mark Dvoretsky has continued to re-examine and re-work the material.  The result is this revised and updated third edition. Not only working independently, but also with the help of attentive readers, masters and grandmasters, the author’s efforts have resulted in what can only be described as the definitive work on endgame theory and practice.  No doubt, when confronted by this massive volume, many chessplayers are intimidated. After all, there are over four hundred large-format pages and over one thousand positions contained in the book. Recognizing the challenge set before the reader, and with an eye to making the material accessible to as many players as possible, Dvoretsky devised a system whereby his Manual could be effectively used by both those wishing to immerse themselves in theory, as well as those wishing a more practical approach.  The key is the author’s concept of using two colors in the text. If your objective is to study and master all the secrets of the endgame, then go through the entire text thoroughly. On the other hand, if you wish to get practical, working knowledge of endings more quickly, then focus your attention only on the text in blue. Either way, you will be rewarded with better results in your games. That is particularly important in this era of rapid time controls and sudden-death finishes.  We hope you will appreciate the author’s passion for the endgame and dedication to producing the most accurate work possible. Regarded by many as Dvoretsky’s magnum opus, it is truly a masterpiece. We wish you good chess, and, of course, better endgames...  Hanon W. Russell  President, Russell Enterprises, Inc.  Milford, Connecticut, USA  July 2011 }

{ Readers familiar with previous editions of the Manual have probably noticed that the new edition is larger than the previous one. But it is not because its content has been significantly increased or is more complicated – it is not. On the contrary, I have tried to make it more accessible to study, adding about 200 new diagrams to the text. Those who read the book without a board  (there are many players who are able to do this)  will find it easier to follow complex examples. In addition, the new diagrams will draw your attention to many interesting and instructive moments previously buried in the text and variations.  As always with new editions, I have revised the text with clarifications and corrections which were found since the release of the previous edition. Significant revisions have been made in some aspects of the theory of rook endings. For that, I would like first and foremost to thank the analyst Vardan Pogosyan. In 2011-2012, I actively corresponded with Pogosyan, and he showed me many of the discoveries he had made, leading me to rethink some important theoretical concepts.  Relatively recently the computer database “Lomonosov” was created; it accurately evaluates seven-piece endings  (previously only six-figure endings were available)  . Naturally, I checked the book’s seven-piece examples with the “Lomonosov” database and corrected any errors found.  Mark Dvoretsky  Moscow  September 2014 }

{ Welcome to this interactive MoveTrainer™ course based on one of the most instructional chess books ever written.  Before you begin this amazing course, here are a  few useful things to know:  We launched a completely new feature/setting for this course, called "Learn important only". It is enabled by default, and it allows you to study only the "blue highlighted" lines that Dvoretsky himself deemed essential to memorize.  This new setting skips over everything else, but you are free to change it and study it all if you'd like. You can change this setting under "Course Options" in your chapter list for this course.  Furthermore, the course has everything that the print book has, all the full text and analysis. All the main lines are trainable/drillable on the site. While this means there are over 1,000 trainable lines, most of the side analysis was not made trainable to keep things manageable.  If you'd like some side analysis to become "trainable", please comment on it, and we will consider the request. We can potentially expand the number of trainable lines there is. You are also free to create a private book, and add such lines to your private course for personal study which may be quicker.  I also wanted to mention that this book had one of our most rigorous beta-tests yet. User "logozar" achieved 220,000 points alone during the beta period. We had many testers and would like to extend thanks to them all.   Despite this for a course of this magnitude it is impossible to test it all. This means that some of our first users have a small chance of encountering some blemishes.  However, don't worry - please remember, Chessable courses are "living" works, continually updated and improved. Just let us know if you spot anything and we will be right on top of it.  Finally, Mark Dvoretsky himself was a big advocate of repetition as a way to improve learning and retention. I hope that between the team, all of you who requested this book, all of you who bought it and all of you who will contribute with feedback, we've made him proud.  After all, we have now brought perhaps his greatest ever work to THE platform for the most efficient spaced repetition based study of his instructional material. In this way, I hope we have all contributed at least a tiny bit so that Dvoretsky's legacy lives on for a long time to come. Thank you Mr Dvoretsky.  Thank you and enjoy the course!

{ Pawn endings are very concrete - even the tiniest change in the position generally alters the shape and outcome of the struggle. Here you can rarely get along on 'general principles' - you must know how to calculate accurately.  The study of pawn endings chiefly boils down, not to the memorization of exact positions, but to the assimilation of standard techniques, which considerably eases our search for a solution and the calculation of variations.  Many pawn endings are clearly defined tempo-battles. In these endgames, speed is everything: which pawn will queen first, will the king come in time to stop the passed pawn or get to the other side of the board in time. And there are other pawn endings in which a maneuvering war predominates, and in which zugzwang assumes paramount importance.  'Maneuvering' endgames are generally more complex than 'rapid' ones, but we shall begin with them anyway, in order to acquire the vital concept of 'corresponding' squares.' Then we shall switch to studying the ideas involved in 'rapid' endgames, before returning once again to the 'maneuvering.' }

The most commonly seen cases of corresponding squares are: the opposition, mined squares, and triangulation.  @@HeaderStart@@Opposition@@HeaderEnd@@  Opposition is the state of two kings standing on the same file with one square separating them  ('close' opposition, three or five squares between them, is called 'distant' opposition)  ; the opposition may be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.  'To get the opposition' means to achieve this standing of the kings one square apart with the opponent to move  (that is, to place him in zugzwang)  ; 'to fall into opposition' means, conversely, to fall into zugzwang oneself.  Return to Key Squares 1-1, where we see the simplest case of the opposition  (close, vertical)  . With White to move, there is no win: }
1. Kc5 { Or  1.Ke5  Ke7. } 1... Kc7
{ Black to move loses, because he must allow the enemy king onto one of the key squares: 1...Kc7 2 Ke6; or 1...Ke7 2 Kc6.  When we are speaking of the opposition, it is usually not just one pair of squares, but several, which are under consideration: c5 and c7, d5 and d7, e5 and e7. The stronger side gets the opposition in order to execute an outflanking  (where the enemy king retreats to one side, and our king then attacks the other way)  . The weaker side gets the opposition in order to prevent this outflanking. }

{ Now let's examine the mechanism by which the stronger side can exploit the distant opposition. It is, in fact, quite simple, and consists of the conversion of the distant opposition into close opposition by means of outflanking. If outflanking is not possible, then possession of the distant opposition is worthless.  H. Mattison, 1918  The pawns are lost, after which Black's king will control the key squares in front of the f7-pawn. But White has a tactical resource at hand: he moves both pawns forward to lure Black's pawn nearer to his king allowing him to defend the new key squares. }

2... gxf5 3. Kg1
{ Black controls the distant opposition, but he cannot convert it into close opposition. The problem is that after   3...Kg5  4.Kf1  , outflanking with  4...Kh4  has no point;  and on 4... Kf4   g4  , it is White who takes the close opposition by   4.Kf2   g2  , and Black's king can't use the f5-square as it blocked by his own pawn.  If the king and the pawn could both occupy this square simultaneously, then on the next move the outflanking would be decisive; unfortunately, the rules of chess don't allow such a thing. }

{ Fahrni - Alapin, 1912  The following position is very important, both for itself and as an illustration of the characteristic logic of analyzing corresponding squares.   The kings were on d5 and c8 here; but we shall not place them on the board just yet - let's deal with the squares of correspondence first.   Two pairs of squares of reciprocal zugzwang are obvious right off: d6-d8, and c5-c7. The squares d6 and c5 border on d5; and for Black, the corresponding squares d8 and c7 border on c8. Thus, a standard means of identifying a new correspondence: that of the d5- and c8-squares.   Along with d5 and c5, White has two equally important squares: c4 and d4; while Black has, adjoining the corresponding squares c7 and c8, only one square: d8  (or b8)  . With Black's king on d8, White makes a waiting move with his king, from c4 to d4  (or the reverse)  . Black's king will be forced onto c7 or c8, when White occupies the corresponding square and wins. }

{ In 1968, during a session of training in the calculation of variations  (I find pawn endings quite useful for this)  , I discovered a second solution to this study, based on completely different logic. The d5-square is key here  (with White's king at d5, and Black's at d7, White wins by h4-h5)  .  By the way, with the pawn already on h5, occupying the d5-square is no longer decisive: the key squares are now on the sixth rank - c6, d6 and e6. Which leads us to an important conclusion:  when the pawn structure changes, the system of key squares associated with the position generally changes too, just as with the system of corresponding squares.   With White's king at f4, Black must deal with the threat of g4-g5. It can be parried by putting the black king at e7  (but not f7, since then White will occupy the key square d5)  - which immediately gives us two pairs of corresponding squares: f4-e7 and e4-d6. Next to these, White has two equivalent squares: f3 and e3. Black, meanwhile, has only one - d7. Thus, the winning mechanism becomes clear - triangulation ! }

And if, as in the present example, you must instead cede the opposition to your opponent, I call such cases of corresponding squares the  'anti-opposition.'

Now, what can White do against the black king's march to the center? The only possibility is to attack the h5-pawn. He can draw, if he can meet Ke6 with Kh4  (with the pawn still on e3)  .

{ 1/11. M. Zinar, 1987   While both kings travel to the queenside, they must be aware of the pair of mined squares c4-d6. If the white king should arrive safely at d3, a drawing situation with untouchable pawns arises. However, we should take into account the utmost importance of the potential reciprocal zugzwang position with the kings on e4 and f6 that may occur. Analyzing all this, we discover the correspondence of the squares f4-g6 and g4-h6 and come to the conclusion that an anti-opposition takes place here.    1.Kg5 ?

{ @@HeaderStart@@Pawn Races@@HeaderEnd@@  Let's examine the sort of situation where both players advance simultaneously and queen at the same time, or almost at the same time. Here, the following outcomes are possible:    (1)  One rook's pawn prevents the other rook's pawn from queening;    (2)  The pawn queens with check, and thereby prevents the enemy pawn from queening; or    (3)  We get a 'queen vs. pawn  (or pawns)  ' endgame.   Or, if both pawns queen, then:    (4)  One queen is lost to a 'skewer' check along the file or diagonal;    (5)  Mate follows;    (6)  The queens are exchanged, after which we once again have a pawn ending; or    (7)  We get a queen ending  (either an elementary one, or one with some play to it)  .   In order to get an idea of all these possibilities  (except perhaps the last one)  , we shall present a sizeable number of examples. In the previous chapter we have already seen an ending which transposed into a 'queen vs. pawns' endgame; and earlier, we also saw cases where the king fell into check, or the queen was lost to a skewer check  (see exercises 1/4, 1/7, 1/8, 1/10)  . Quite often, the chief problem of a position is either to draw the enemy king onto a bad square, or to avoid such a square with one's own king. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Active King@@HeaderEnd@@   King activity is the most important factor in the evaluation of position in a pawn endgame.  In fact, not just in pawn endgames - in any endgame. But in pawn endgames, where there are no other pieces on the board, this is perhaps an especially important factor.   The influence the degree of king activity has on the battle's outcome is obvious in many of the preceding and succeeding examples. Here, we examine two vitally important means of exploiting an active king's position: playing for zugzwang, and the widening of the beachhead. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Zigzag@@HeaderEnd@@  The laws of geometry, as we have known them since grade school, have no relevance on the chessboard. There, a straight line is not the shortest distance between two points  (or squares)  - if the king follows a broken-line path, it is by no means longer. This phenomenon is exploited both in the Réti idea we have already examined, and in the 'shoulder block' we shall learn later on.   Here, we shall speak of a technique closely connected with the simultaneous advance of pawns we just studied. To be more exact: we shall be speaking of two techniques, which look very similar. Let's call them 'zigzag.' }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Outside Passed Pawn@@HeaderEnd@@  An outside passed pawn usually means a positional advantage sufficient to win. This pawn will draw off the enemy king, allowing the other king to be the first to attack the enemy pawns.   For example, in Diagram 1-103, after 1 c4 !, stopping the threatened enemy breakthrough, we broke off our analysis, since the further exploitation of the outside passed pawn is elementary here.   Of course, that is not always the case. In the endgames Kharlov-Ernst  (Diagram 1-107)  or Nakagawa-Day  (Diagram 1-110)  , the proper outcome would have been a draw, despite the presence of an outside passed pawn. And in the game Hansen-Nimzovitch  (Diagram 1-83)  , Black met the threat of an outside passed pawn with the activation of his king, which even won for him. }

{ If it is Black to move, after } 1... a5
{ the position is drawn, as you may easily determine: Black's king has enough time to get to c8. But let's say that we move the kings and the f-pawn one rank down, or one file to the left; then, once again, Black loses. But what if we also move the queenside pawns one rank down ?  Of course, with the position right in front of us, any question is easily answered. But in practice, such situations often occur at the end of long calculations, and extending such calculations a few moves further still could be most difficult. It would be good to have a definite evaluation of this position immediately, as soon as we lay eyes on it.  Bähr demonstrated such a means of quick appraisal in 1936. I did not find his rule very convenient for us; in addition, it was not designed to work when the king would be, not to one side, but ahead of the pawn. So therefore I offer a somewhat different method of quickly evaluating this sort of position.   (1)  The first rule is similar to Bähr's rule:  If the rook's pawn of the stronger side has crossed the middle of the board, it is always a win.    (2)  We shall designate a 'normal' position, in which:  (a)  the rook's pawns, which block one another, are separated by the middle of the board; and  (b)  Black's king, aiming for the c8-square, can reach it without loss of time. This is because the passed pawn has either traversed the key diagonal h3-c8, or stands upon it.   The 'normal' position is drawn.    (3)  For the kingside passed pawn, every square behind the h3-c8 diagonal is an extra tempo for White. For example: the pawn at f4 means one extra tempo; the pawn at e4 - two. And if the king is not beside the passed pawn, but in front of it, that is another extra tempo.  And every square the queenside pawns are behind the 'normal' position is an extra tempo for the defending side. With pawns at a3/a4, Black has an extra tempo in his favor; with pawns at a2/a3 - two.   White wins only if the relative number of tempi calculated by the means shown above is in his favor. }

{ The formulation may seem a bit ungainly, but once memorized, it is quite easy to apply. For example:  White of course is on move  (if it were Black to move, the f-pawn would queen)  . White wins, because the count is 3:2 in his favor. Black has two tempi, because the queenside pawns are two squares behind the 'normal' position. White's f3-pawn is two squares lower than the h3-c8 diagonal  (the f5-square)  , and his king, being in front of the pawn, gives him three tempi. }
1. Ke4
{ 1.Ke3 ?  Ke5 =   f5  would be a terrible blunder, because then we would have a position where the tempi are 2:2  (White's king is no longer in front of the f-pawn, but next to it)  - which makes it a draw. }

{ Matanovic - Botvinnik, Belgrade 1969  In his notes, Botvinnik analyzed two approaches for White: 1 Rd5, and 1 Rd6+ Ke7 2 Ra6. In fact, he had a third try:   1.Kf2 !  For example  1...exd3  2.Ke3  Ra1   2...Rg1  3.Kf2  3.Rxd3  Rxa4  4.Rd6+  followed by 5 Ra6, when White must draw.  But suppose we forget about this possibility, and try to choose the more exact of the two possible rook moves.   First, we must try some short variations, in order to establish the differences between them, to compare their advantages and their shortcomings.  On   1.Rd6+  Ke7  2.Ra6  a clear draw follows  Rxd3  3.Rxa5  or   2...Rd2+  3.Nf2  e3  4.Kf3 !   4.Rxa5  Rxf2+  5.Kg1  is also possible  4...e2   4...exf2  5.Kg2  5.Ra7+  However, the pawn capture on d3 is unpleasant:   2...exd3  3.Rxa5  Kd6  Now  4.Kf2 ?  is bad in view of  so White must continue   4.Ra8  allowing the black king to get closer to his passed d-pawn.  4...Rg1 !

{ Matanovic - Botvinnik, Belgrade 1969  (continued)    Unfortunately, here too it is not clear whether White can be saved. Nonetheless, pawn endings are generally of a more forcing nature than rook endings are. Here, as a rule, it is possible to obtain an accurate appraisal of the position, if you can take a variation to its conclusion. So it makes sense to concentrate our efforts on the calculation of this pawn endgame.   Black has two plans of action: bringing the king to the center, in the hope of putting his opponent in zugzwang, and the kingside break with g6-g5.   We can easily establish that the first plan is harmless:   4...Ke6  5.Ke3  Kd6   5...Kd5  6.Kxd3  h6  7.g4  6.Kxd3  Kd5  7.g4  h6  on   7...fxg4  8.hxg4  h5  there is  9.f5 !  although   9.gxh5  gxh5  10.Ke3  does not lose  8.g5 !  hxg5   8...h5  9.h4  9.fxg5  f4  10.h4  Ke5  11.Ke2  with equality. }

{ We have already seen the situation occurring after   7...f4  8.gxf4+  Kxf4  in the previous example.

For example:  9.h4  or   9.Kd4  9...Kg4  10.Ke4  Kxh4  11.Kf4  with a draw. }

{ Matanovic - Botvinnik, Belgrade 1969  (continued)    Which of the two natural moves - 9 Ke3 or 9 Ke2 - should White make ? Let's go back to the rule laid down above. After Black wins the h-pawn, our 'arithmetic' shows that he will have one tempo, since the f-pawn is one square above the crucial c1-h6 diagonal. White can only save himself if he can force that pawn forward to f4.  So clearly   9.Ke2 ?  loses:  Kg3  ⨀  10.h4   10.Kf1  Kxh3  11.Kf2  Kg4  and Black now has two tempi.  10...Kxh4  11.Kf3  Kg5  12.Kg3  Kf6  13.Kf4  Ke6  14.Kf3  Kd5  etc. }

The only thing to be done then is to advance one's own passed pawn, and exchange it for the other side's passed pawn. Sometimes this wins, sometimes not. In the similar situation that occurred as one of the variations of the game Averbakh-Bebchuk  (Diagram 1-112)  , we were able to lose a move to Black, making use of our reserve tempo  (in that case, h4-h5)  . }

Looking for an improvement for White, we come back to   1.Kg5  Yes, it creates no threat but still, how should Black react ?  Kb6  is bad in view of  If   1...Kb8  then  2.f4 !  b5  3.f5  gxf5  4.exf5  and the f-pawn promotes first with check.  2.Kxg6 !  (the black king is an obstacle for ...b7-b5)  ; the same reply follows after 1...Ka6. If 2...b5, White takes the pawn with check.

{ Yusupov - Ionov, Podolsk 1977  We can see at once the idea of a pawn breakthrough on the queenside, after a2-a4 and c4-c5. Obviously, it will have no chance of succeeding unless the black king is taken far enough away.   First, it is necessary to put Black on move. It is also important to leave the a-pawn where it is, since from its original square, it has the choice of moving one or two squares forward. }

{ N. Grigoriev, 1920  We shall analyze the basic ideas of such positions by using the following study as an example.  If White plays   1.Kh1 ?  then after  Kg4  his position is lost.  Naively hoping for   1...f2 ?? =  stalemate.  Black's plan is elementary: his king goes to e3, and then he advances ...f3-f2, forcing the advance of White's h-pawn. The fact that Black can choose whether to move his h-pawn one or two squares forward allows him to place his opponent in zugzwang. For example:  2.Kg1  Kf4  3.Kf2  Ke4  4.Kf1   4.Ke1  Ke3  5.Kf1  f2  6.h4  h5 !  4...Ke3  5.Ke1  f2+  6.Kf1  Kf3 !  7.h3  or   7.h4  h6 !  8.h5  Kg3  7...h5 !  8.h4  Kg3 }
1. Kf2 Kg4 2. Ke3
{ ⨀ Thanks to zugzwang, the pawn must leave the h7-square; the position is now a draw. White must only make sure he chooses the right back-rank square for his king  (corresponding to the position of Black's h-pawn)  . }

{ 6...h4  would be met by  7.Kf1 !  But not the hasty   7.h3 ?  which would be a terrible blunder here, leading to the Fahrni-Alapin ending we know so well  (from Diagram 1-27)  . Just a reminder: Black wins by triangulating with his king:  Ke4  8.Kf1  Ke5  9.Ke1  Kf5 !  10.Kf1  Ke4  ⨀  7...f2  8.h3 = }
7. Kf1 Kf3 8. h3 Kg3 9. h4

{ Vaganian - Sunye Neto, Rio de Janeiro izt 1979  Maizelis' position serves as a most important guidepost in analyzing situations where one side has an advanced rook's pawn - the outcome of the battle depends on whether the stronger side can reach Maizelis' position and whose move it is.   Maizelis studied the following position, and considered it lost. His conclusion would appear to be supported by the result of this game.   61.Kg3  h5 !  62.Kf3  On   62.Kg2  Black should play  Kf4 !  And if   62.Kf2  then  Kg4 !  63.Ke3  or   63.Kg2  h4  63...Kh3  62...h4  63.Kg2  Kg4 !  64.Kf2  Kf4  65.Ke2  Ke4  (White is in zugzwang)  66.Kf2  Kd3 !!  67.Kf3  h3 !  White resigned.  I was in Rio de Janeiro. Unfamiliar with Maizelis' analysis, and astounded that Black could win such a position, I focused on it intensely and quickly found the saving line. Pal Benko  (who was Sunye Neto's second at the Interzonal)  came to the same conclusion a bit earlier.  Since the central problem here is one of reciprocal zugzwang, let's analyze the corresponding squares. If Black's king moves to the fourth rank with the pawn at h4 or h6, White's king must respond by taking the opposition. If the pawn is at h5, the opposite is true - White must take the anti-opposition.  This means that neither   61.Kg2 ?  Kg4 !  Nor   61.Kf2 ?  Kf4 !  is good.  And we have already seen what happens to 61. Kg3 ? So: }

{ Tragicomedies: Laveryd - Wikstrm, Ume 1997   With the following difficult, but beautiful example, I wish to close this chapter devoted to pawn endgames. The comments are based on those of Lindgren in Informant 74.   On the queenside, the two kings have already occupied the mined squares b3 and c5. It would seem that the side  (let's say, Black)  that first runs out of pawn moves will lose. So the correct answer - that the position is a draw - appears paradoxical.  The first question is: How is Black to avoid losing immediately ? For   1...f6 ?   or  1...f5 ?  is completely hopeless in view of  2.exf6  gxf6  3.g4 ! }
1... h5
{ It turns out that, after the natural   2.h4 ?  it is not White who places his opponent in zugzwang - he falls into it himself:  g5 !  3.hxg5  h4  ⨀  By the way, this example fully deserves to be placed in 'Tragicomedies,' since the actual continuation was   1...h6 ??  2.h3 ??   2.g4 !  g6  or   2...f5  3.exf6  gxf6  4.h4  +-  3.h4  +-  2...h5 !  -+  3.h4  g5 !  4.g3  g4  and White resigned. }

But now, Black once again faces a tough defensive task.   2...g5 ?  loses at once to  3.g3  And   2...f5 ?  to  3.h4  No better is   2...h4 ?  3.g3 !  hxg3   3...g5  4.g4  4.fxg3  f5  5.exf6  gxf6  6.h4   2...g6 ?  is elegantly refuted by  3.g4 !

As soon as White plays either Nd2 or Kd3, he falls into zugzwang; and if Black is too hasty with either ...f2 or ...Kf4, the zugzwang position occurs with him to move instead. Thus, we have a case known to us from pawn endings: mined squares. However, this is the only case I know of where the squares are mined for four different pieces at once, and not for the usual two.  And now, for the solution. White must play much as in the last variation, except that he must place his knight, not on c4, but on b3, leaving the c4-square open for his king. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Deflecting Knight Sacrifice@@HeaderEnd@@  We shall not be making a systematic examination of the endgame in which a knight faces a knight and pawn: its theory is quite complex, and in my view, rather chaotic. There are no principles which are operative for many positions; the evaluation and the course of the struggle depend entirely upon the concrete details.   The deflecting knight sacrifice is the almost universally employed technique in such endings.  And not only in these – there are many situations in which one side tries to queen its own passed pawn or to break into the enemy’s camp with his king. }

Such techniques as the pawn breakthrough, shouldering, the various methods of playing for zugzwang, and so forth, are seen constantly, not just in pawn endgames, but also in knight endgames.

Such a position is called a fortress, and the method is called constructing a fortress.   I use the term “elementary fortress” to mean those theoretical positions with minimal material and a king usually placed on the edge or in a corner of the board, in which the stronger side proves unable to exploit a significant material advantage. We have already encountered such positions in the chapter on “Knight vs. Pawns”  (Diagrams 2-2, 2-4, and 2-5)  .

I might add  (without giving the full proof, which is pretty weighty)  that if, in Rauzers starting position, we move the pawn on a3 back to a2, the evaluation changes. White will try to stalemate the enemy king  (while still keeping him away from the corner, of course)  , in order to force the move a4-a3, after which the bishop can pick off the pawn. If Black tries to avoid this scenario, then he must move his king into the center, which will allow White, by playing a2-a3 at the right moment, to obtain the bad black king situation we have already seen. }

{ V. Rauzer, 1928  Now for one more variation on Rauzer's position  (analyzed by Horwitz and Averbakh)  . Let's add a black pawn at b5.  Now the king's arrival in that upper left-hand corner is mortally dangerous. It will be stalemated, and be forced to play ...b5-b4, when the a3-pawn goes to the b-file. White to move wins quickly by 1. Ba5 Kb8 2. Bb6 Ka8   2...Kc8  3.Bc7  ⨀  3. Kc7 ⨀ b4 4. axb4 +-.  But Black to move renders the position drawn, since White can no longer stalemate the king. The move ...b5-b4 is no longer even fatal; in fact, at the right moment it will be Blacks salvation. }

In chess jargon, this situation is referred to as  ( )  'the pants'  ( )  : the bishop stops pawns on two different diagonals, but advancing one of the pawns means the bishop must give up its guard over the other. This is the same sort of pants situation that could have arisen in the Gutman-Mikenas game  (Diagram 4-6)  after the correct 1 e6 or 1 h6.  Sometimes, the bishop is not holding a passed pawn on one of the two diagonals, but defending its own pawn, or some other important point. For all practical purposes, this is the same thing: advancing a pawn pulls the bishop away from fulfilling its other obligation. An example of this might be Smyslov's study  (Exercise 4/4)  .  Keep in mind also that there are other ways to exploit a torn bishop. Sometimes, it may be driven away from the intersection of two diagonals by the king, or forced to move away by means of zugzwang.

{ @@HeaderStart@@Opposite-Color Bishops@@HeaderEnd@@  The Most Important Rules  Endings with opposite-colored bishops are perhaps the most strategic of them all. My studies of these endings have taught me some rules which will help you get your bearings in nearly all such endings.   I. Drawing Tendencies   Here it is frequently possible to save oneself even two or three pawns down. The consequences of this rule are obvious:  the stronger side must be exceptionally alert, whether going into an opposite-color bishops endgame, or playing one out here it does not take long to stumble on a drawing counter-chance. And for the weaker side, going into the opposite-color bishops ending is sometimes the key to salvation, sharply increasing the chances for a favorable outcome.   II. The Fortress    The main theme of opposite-color bishops endings is that of the Fortress. The weaker side strives to create one, the stronger side strives to prevent its formation, or  (if it already exists)  to find a way to break through it.    An important factor in endgame play is the ability to analyze a position logically, to think through various plans and schemes. Logical thinking is of special importance in endings with oppositecolor bishops. In the majority of cases, such endings are not played as much as they are constructed first it is necessary to determine the configuration of pawns and pieces which will render the position impenetrable; only then can we proceed with the calculation of variations which will prove whether or not we can attain the desired configuration, and whether it is in fact impenetrable.   The following rules show the most important techniques for setting up and breaking down fortresses.   III. Pawn Placement   In the next chapter, we discuss the principle that requires us to place our pawns on the opposite color squares from that controlled by our bishop. In opposite-color bishop endings, this principle only holds true for the stronger side it is especially important with connected passed pawns.   But  the weaker side must, contrary to the general rule, keep his pawns on the same color squares as his own bishop  in that event, he will usually be able to defend them. In fact, a pawn defended by its bishop can only be attacked by the enemy king which renders it invulnerable. In other types of endgames, such a pawn could be attacked, not just by the king, but also by other pieces  (such as a knight, or a bishop of the same color)  .   IV. Positional Nuances are Worth More than Material   When we are playing an opposite-color bishops ending, the number of pawns on the board frequently has less significance than a small alteration in the placement of pieces or pawns even an apparently insignificant one. Therefore,  in opposite-color bishops endgames, we quite frequently encounter positional pawn sacrifices.    V. The One-Diagonal Principle   We have already met this principle in the Bishop vs. Pawns endgame  (Chapter 4)  .  For both the stronger and the weaker side it, is very important that the bishop should both defend its own and stop the enemy pawns without tearing that is, along one and the same diagonal.   VI. Pawns in the Crosshairs    A typical means of defense is for the bishop to attack the enemy pawns.  This will either force their advance, to the less favorable squares of the color of their own bishop, or tie the enemy king to the pawns' defense. This technique, like the previous one, was also studied in Chapter 4. In opposite-color bishops endgames, both techniques are used frequently.  The logical thing would be to illustrate each of these rules by concrete examples. However, that would be difficult, only because they are rarely employed separately. Consider the following simple endgame, and you will see all of the rules we have been talking about, appearing simultaneously. }

{ The draw is obvious White need only run his bishop up and down the h3-c8 diagonal. Thus, White was able to save himself three  (!)  pawns down   (drawing tendency)  . The final position is a fortress, in which the weaker sides only pawn is properly placed on the same color square as its own bishop. The bishop defends its pawn at h3 and holds the enemy pawns at g5 and f6 on the same diagonal. White sacrificed a pawn, so that by attacking the enemy\s sole, well-placed pawn at e6, he could force it to advance to a dark square, after which the pawns could be easily blockaded.   Analyzing almost any endgame in this chapter, you will see some or all of our just-formulated rules in action. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Bishop and Two Connected Pawns vs. Bishop@@HeaderEnd@@Careful analysis of the following basic theoretical position will familiarize us with the characteristic ideas of such endgames.   White threatens to continue e5-e6, followed by Ke5 and f5-f6. To stop this plan, Black must take the e6-square under control with his bishop. But from d7 or from b3 ? Lets examine both choices.  On   1...Bb3 ?  the position is lost. First, White gives a probing check, to see which way the enemy king goes. It is important to have the bishop prevent it from getting between the pawns after e5-e6.  Therefore,  2.Bg5+ !  Note that the bishop check from the other side is ineffective:   2.Bb4+  Kf7 !  3.Kd4 ?  Bc2 !  4.e6+  Kf6  5.e7  Ba4  and draws. As soon as the pawns are blocked on the same color squares as their bishop, the draw becomes obvious.  Then, the white king goes to help the e-pawn from the side opposite the one the enemy king went to. For example:  2...Kf7  Or   2...Kd7  3.Kf4  Ba2  4.Bh4  Bf7  5.Kg5  Ke7  6.Kh6+  Kd7  7.Kg7  Bc4  8.Kf6  and 9. e6+, winning.  3.Kd4  Ba2  4.Kc5  Bb3   4...Bb1  5.e6+  and 6. f6  5.Kd6  and 6. e6+.

1... Bd7 2. Bg5+ Kf7
{ Now Black merely waits, shuttling the bishop back and forth between c8 and d7. In order to prepare e5-e6, White needs to maneuver his king left. But this is impossible, as long as the king is tied to the defense of the f5-pawn. Which suggests a rule: The bishop must be placed where it prevents the advance of one of the pawns while simultaneously attacking the other. }

{ Let's look at a more complex case.  M. Henneberger, 1916   Black's bishop is not ideally posted it should be at either e7 or d8. In the basic theoretical position we started with, White won easily against such a bishop. Proceeding logically, it would seem that only one circumstance could hinder the execution of the standard winning plan, and that is the nearness of the boards edge. Let's see:  'According to the rules,' one should first check on h5, in order to control the g6-square. Black retreats his king to e7, forcing Whites king to go on a right-hand outflanking, where there is little room to maneuver.   1.Bh5+  Ke7 !  On   1...Kg7 ?  2.Ke4  Black does not have the same resources to prevent a left-hand outflanking.  2.Kg4  Bb2  3.Bg6  (there is no other way of making progress; but now the g6-square is not available to the king)  Bc3  4.Kh5  (threatening 5 Kh6, 6 Bh5 etc.)  Bg7 !  5.Bh7  Kf7 !  6.Bg6+  Ke7  and White cannot reach his goal of preparing f5-f6+.  And the bishop check on the other diagonal we already know gives nothing:   1.Bc4+  Kg7 !  2.Ke4  Bd2 !  3.f6+  Kg6  However, Whites resources for playing to win are not yet exhausted. We could decoy the king to g7 first, and then put the bishop on the e8-h5 diagonal, thus preparing a left-hand outflanking by the king. }

{ It is interesting to analyze those situations in which it is impossible to realize a material advantage. Here are some instances:   If one of the pawns is a rook pawn, and the bishop does not control the queening square, the draw can be secured by blocking that pawn with the king and sacrificing the bishop for the other.   If the pawns are separated by just one file, then the stronger side will only be able to win the bishop for the two pawns  (imagine white pawns at c6 and e6 with the black king at d8, and the bishop restraining the pawn which is supported by Whites king)  .   Sometimes the weaker sides king can help the bishop defend against both pawns at once. It  'maintains the zone'   (an expression borrowed from hockey)  , by shuttling to whichever flank it is needed to prevent the enemy king from invading its territory. This kind of defense is very important when the pawns are split. }

The game continued:   51.e4 ?  d4 !  52.Bc4  Bb7  53.Kg5  Bc8  54.Kf4  Kd7  55.Kf3  Bb7  56.Ke2  Bc8  57.Kd3  Bb7  58.Kxd4  Bc8  59.Ke3  Bb7  and a draw was agreed. In the final position, Whites own e4-pawn only causes him trouble because it closes the important h1-a8 diagonal. Without this pawn, White would have had the upper hand. So the correct plan is a king transfer to d4 prior to the advance e3-e4. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Barrier@@HeaderEnd@@  Although there are occasional cases where a player can save himself with his pawns on the same color as his bishop, such a defensive method is not to be recommended in the majority of cases. The more secure defensive method is  to control the squares of one color with the bishop, and of the other color, with pawns.  This places a barrier in the path of the enemy king, making it difficult to invade our camp.   If the opponent has a passed pawn, the king must usually blockade it. }

{ I. Ivanov - Christiansen, Pasadena 1983  White's position is difficult. The e3-pawn greatly restricts the bishop's mobility; and on the other wing, the same role is played by the enemy pawns  (White's bishop will not likely ever have the opportunity to attack them from behind.)   Nevertheless, as Christiansen pointed out, White has a comparatively simple way to draw he must sacrifice a pawn, opening the diagonal for his bishop and erecting an impassable barrier before the black king. }

If it succeeds, lets say, in blockading the passed pawn on one wing, it cannot successfully involve itself in the fray on the opposite wing.

{ Perelstein - Vepkhvishvili, Pushkin Hills 1977  (continued)    The bishop can find no square on the long diagonal:   56.Bf6 ?  loses to the interference move  Nd4  And   56.Bc3 ?  is met by  Kc4  All that is left to hope for is his pawns.

In Chapter 12, which is devoted to the theory of queen endgames, you will read that in such situations the only hope for salvation lies in the black king getting as close as possible to the corner square a1. Black should therefore play  60...Kc5 !  For example:   60...Kd6  61.Qg6+  Ke7  62.Qxc2  Qh1+  63.Kg7  Qxf3  64.Qc7+  Ke6  65.Qb6+  Kd7  66.Qf6  with a winning queen endgame.   60...Kd4 ?  61.Qg7+  61.Qc8+  Kb4  62.Qxc2  Qh1+  63.Kg7  Qxf3  The computer assures us that the resulting position is drawn; however, to demonstrate this evaluation right at the board is quite difficult as a rule, the defending side errs somewhere along the way, and loses. }

But strategic methods are also often used. Let's enumerate the most important ones:    Blockading the passed pawns;     Fixing the enemy pawns on the same color squares as his bishop;     Erecting a barrier   - the knight and pawns take control of a complex of important squares, preventing the incursion of the enemy king or at least making that incursion much more difficult;    Erecting a fortress.

Black is not afraid of zugzwang because he has two squares for his king: f6 and g6.  White cannot do without a king transfer to the queenside.

{ @@HeaderStart@@When the Knight is Stronger than the Rook@@HeaderEnd@@  The knight is no weaker, and sometimes even stronger, than the rook when the board is strewn with pawn chains and the rook has nowhere to break into the enemy camp.  Another possibility: sometimes, the rook has a hard time dealing with a far-advanced enemy passed pawn supported by the knight. In such situations, the knights tactical abilities come to the fore; it can create forks, win tempi by checking the enemy king, or cut the rook off from the pawn. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Rook Endgames@@HeaderEnd@@  Rook endings are perhaps the most important and most difficult kind of endgame. Most important, because they occur in practice much more often than other endings. Most difficult, because one must absorb and remember a much greater volume of knowledge than in endings with other material relationships.  The reason is that, in other endgames, situations with a minimum number of pawns on the board are either elementary or not very important. Therefore one needs only to remember a very limited number of precise positions, as it is highly improbable that one would meet them in practical play. So, mastering the basic ideas and methods is fully sufficient in those cases.  In rook endings, however, a sophisticated theory of positions with reduced material exists  (for example, those with R+P against R)  , and these situations occur very often in practice. This means that we cannot omit studying a considerable number of precise positions. }

{ Hence we can conclude:   (1)  If the pawn is on the seventh rank, multiple winning methods exist. The most important ones are  building a bridge  for protection from checks along files and  a rook maneuver for protection from side checks  along ranks.   (2)  When the king of the weaker side is cut off from the pawn, the only defensive technique consists in  side checks .   (3)  A rook pursuit of the enemy king can only be successful when  the rook and the pawn are separated at minimum by three lines.  As we shall see later, this rule does not only pertain to side checks.   (4)  A central or a bishop pawn divides the chessboard into two unequal parts: one is long, another is short.  The correct positioning of forces for the weaker side is to keep the king on the short side, and the rook on the long side. }

The cases of a less advanced pawn are much more complicated, and they occur much less often, therefore we shall not investigate them. I wish only to mention that the distance between the pawn and the hostile rook is longer when the pawn stands on the second or third rank, and the defending resources are naturally more significant. Therefore, for example, if the pawn stands on the third rank, the king should be cut off by three files for a win  (with only two files it is a draw if, of course, Black’s king and rook are placed "in accordance with the rules")  .  It deserves to be mentioned that a frontal attack is particularly effective against a rook pawn. For example, with a pawn on a4, even cutting the king off by three files is not sufficient for a win. }

{ Let us look at a more complicated but quite useful situation that can occur in a practical game.  G. Kasparian, 1946  For the time being, let us accept that White wins if he succeeds in transferring his rook to the fifth rank. This means that Black dare not play either 1... Kf8 2 Rf7+ ∆ Rf5 or 1.. .Rd3 2 Rc7 Rh3   2...Rd5  3  h6  3 Rc5. Therefore his rook must stay on g3 and h3. But what can Black do when the white king comes to the kingside ?  It turns out to be difficult for White. If his king comes to g2 when the black rook is on h3, then 1... Ra3 is playable, because 2 Rb7 Ra5 ! 3 h6 Rg5+ loses a pawn; the same happens after 2 Kh2 Rb3 3 Ra7 Rb5 !.  If White plays 2 Kf2 the rook goes back to h3. By the way here, as in all similar positions, 3 h6 Rh5 4 Kf3 Rg5 5 Rg7+ Kh8 6 Kf4 Rf5   g4  +! leads nowhere.  However if, with the white king on f2 and the black rook on h3, Black is on move, he comes to be in zugzwang. His rook must leave its comfortable position behind the pawns, and then the white rook has the opportunity to leave h7.  We have come to the conclusion that f2 and h3 are the squares of the reciprocal zugzwang. Obviously enough, another pair of such squares is e2 and g3. Furthermore, when the white king stands on any dark square of the second rank the black rook must be on h3 while, when the king stands on a light square, the rook must be on g3 !. }

The best position for the rook is on a1; it is ideally suited for giving checks along files as well as ranks. However, if the pawns are not advanced too far, the rook stands quite well on the fifth rank, and sometimes on f1. }

{ Vaiser - Djuric, Szirak 1985  In comparison with the previous ending, the black pawns are less advanced.

Tarrasch's rule is valid for the overwhelming majority of rook-and-pawn endings but, as it goes without saying, not for absolutely all of them. Generally speaking, there is no rule in chess which does not have an exception.  An amateur followed Tarraschs rule in a correspondence game and had to resign immediately after receiving his opponents reply. He wrote an irritated letter to the grandmaster: "I relied upon your authority but lost because of you, with your stupid rule..."  Tarrasch published it in his chess column with the final position of that game, adding the following annotation: "Especially for this reader and a few similar to him  (the majority, as I am sure, do not need it)  , I supplement my rule. You should always place your rook behind a pawn. Except for the cases when this is unfavorable !" }

{ Sometimes the weaker side employs another, more active defensive method: the king is advanced to support the passed pawn. As a consequence, this pawn will cost a whole rook for the stronger side, but in the meantime his own pawns, together with the king, will be advanced too far, and the endgame 'two connected passed pawn against a rook' turns out to be winning.   Therefore this tactic has practical chances only against less advanced pawns and misplaced pieces of the stronger side. As, for example, in the following case:  Reshevsky - Alekhine, AVRO 1938  It would have been an easy draw for Black with the white rook on a1: 1... Ke6 2 Kg3 Kf6. In our case, however, a passive defense is hopeless:   57...Ke6 ?  58.Kg3  Kf6  59.h3  Kg6  Or   59...Rc2  60.Kh4  Rh2  61.Ra6+  Ke5  62.Kg5 !

{ If the rook protects pawns from the side and the enemy king blocks the passed pawn, then the pieces of the stronger side attack the opponent's pawn on the other wing, while the passed pawn, if necessary, can be sacrificed.   An interesting example of this strategy follows in the next diagram. Studying it, we should refresh our memories about the theory of rook and pawn versus rook endgames, particularly the case of frontal attack.   Rigan - Yandemirov, Budapest 1993  According to the above-mentioned rule, Black must attack the g4-pawn. But how is he to do this ?

If the eventual pawn endgame is drawn, the weaker side drives away the hostile rook, from the rank where it is protecting both pawns, by means of the exchange threat.

{ In this way Black makes his task of reaching a draw considerably easier.  The defender should advance his h-pawn. The stronger side, whenever possible should prevent this by means of g3-g4 !.   The explanation consists in the fact that Whites most logical plan is an advance of his e- and f-pawns in order to create a passed pawn. To accomplish this plan, he must sooner or later play g3-g4, allowing a pawn exchange on g4. But, as we know,  pawn exchanges are usually favorable for the weaker side, and improve the drawing chances.  Without ...h7-h5, the h-pawns would have stayed on the board.

{ Tragicomedies: Piket - Kasparov, Internet Tournament 2000  White has succeeded in bringing his pawn to e5  (generally speaking, it would have been favorable for Black if he prevented this by playing ...f7-f6 at an earlier stage)  . On the other hand, ...h6-h5 has already been played, so reaching a draw should not be a very difficult problem.  Kasparov had to decide how to react should the white king march to g5 via h3 and h4. The simplest method was to play ...Kh6 at the proper moment. For example,   41...Kg7  42.Kh3  Ra7  43.Kh4  Kh6 !  and one cannot see how White could make any progress.  Moreover, a king invasion to g5 is not too dangerous. Even with the white rook on the seventh rank Black can survive.

{ @@HeaderStart@@Balance on One Wing and an Extra Pawn on Another@@HeaderEnd@@  Situations with an extra distant passed pawn occur now and then, therefore it is very important to learn their correct evaluation and handling.  The decisive factor in this sort of endgame is the position of the rook of the stronger side. In the majority of cases, the rook is placed best ' la Tarrasch,' behind its own passed pawn; sometimes its sideways position is preferable.   Quite often, however, we lack free choice, so the rook mostly stands in front of the pawn in practical games. Therefore we shall pay more attention to these cases. }

For example,  71.Ka7   71.Kc6  Ra8  72.Kb5  Rb8+  73.Ka4  Ra8  71...Rb1   71...Rf8 ?  does not work  72.Rf4  +-  72.a6  Kh5 !  73.Ka8  Rb2  74.a7  and now the saving move is  Rb5 !

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Rook in Front of the Pawn, with the Pawn on the Seventh Rank@@HeaderEnd@@  We have seen a section with an identical title in the theory of a rook and a rook pawn versus a rook endgames. The ideas from that section will be useful for our current considerations.   A pawn advance to the seventh rank absolutely shackles the opponents forces. However, if there are no vulnerable points in his camp, the game is still drawn because a king march to the pawn is useless: no refuge from rook checks from behind is provided.   Pushing the pawn to the seventh rank makes sense, and offers winning chances when one of the following three plans is possible. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Rook in Front of the Pawn, with the Pawn on the Sixth Rank@@HeaderEnd@@   If a pawn advance to a7 makes no sense, White leaves the pawn on a6 and brings his king to the queenside where it has a refuge against vertical checks. But it is a long way to go, leaving the black rook enough time to capture one or two pawns, before it must be sacrificed for the a-pawn. This leads to a sharp Rook vs. Pawns endgame, the outcome of which will depend on whether Whites king can get back to the kingside in time.   For many years, it was believed that with correct defense, the draw was an easy matter, something Black could achieve with a couple of tempi to spare. This point of view was espoused in, among other places, earlier editions of my Endgame Manual. In the latter half of 2003, the theory of this portion of the endgame underwent some revolutionary changes. Blacks position, it turned out, was far more dangerous than it had seemed. }

{ Johannes Steckner, a Swiss player, while checking the analysis of one of the basic positions which had been considered drawn, found a tremendous improvement for White, leading to a win for him. And his discovery led, in turn, to new researches which were conducted by Steckner, grandmasters Karsten Müller and Rustem Dautov, along with other endgame connoisseurs. The results of our research are reflected in the Russian edition of the Endgame Manual, as well as the second and third releases of the American edition and the second, third and fourth releases of the German edition.  The development of this theory has not remained static. In late 2011, an Armenian chess aficionado, Vardan Pogosyan, provided additional support that the position under consideration was nevertheless still drawn. Pogosyan also made substantial refinements in the analysis of other endings included in this section of the Endgame Manual.  Here I shall present only the most important and interesting variations, omitting many of the analytical details. For those who seek more detailed information, I would recommend visiting @@LinkStart@@www.chesscafe.com@@LinkEnd@@ and looking for my article published in October/November 2003, as well as articles by Karsten Müller, the last of which, dedicated to Pogosyans discoveries, was published in March 2012.  Nevertheless, even in edited form, the material I offer for your consideration is so large and complex, that it clearly exceeds the boundaries I tried to maintain when I wrote this Endgame Manual. The excuse I offer is its newness and enormous practical significance to the theory of this sort of endgame.  Nothing could be further from my mind than to label the analysis presented below as the last word of theory, for long, complicated variations rarely turn out error-free. But in any case, they go a long way to correct and develop the pre-existing conclusions, and may in turn serve as a starting point for additional theoretical researches.  V. Kantorovich, 1988, J. Steckner, 2003  In 1989, Vadim Kantorovich, of Moscow, published an interesting article titled, The Outside Passed Pawn. The article opened with the diagrammed position. The main conclusion of the analysis was: Black draws with two tempi to spare. In fact, he is almost lost.  But, it turns out, almost ! }

{ The pawn must be sacrificed  precisely  with the rook on a7 !   1.Ra8 ?  Kf5  would be much weaker. Please note that  Blacks pieces are optimally placed: the rook holds the f-pawn in the crosshairs, while the king occupies the most active available square.    Black would have an easy draw after  2.Kd4  Or   2.f3  Ra3+  3.Kd4  Rxf3  4.Rf8  Ra3  5.Rxf7+  Kg4  6.Rf6  Kxg3  7.Rxg6+  Kxh4  8.Kc5  Kh3  9.Kb6  h4 =  (Fine)  On   2.Ra7 !?  the king should not pull back with 2... Ke6 ? or 2... Kf6 ?, but immediately begin counterplay by  f6 !?   2...Kg4  3.Rxf7  Rxa6  does not lose either.  So White plays  3.Ra8  instead, threatening to obtain a winning position with the pawn on the seventh, known to us from the Unzicker-Lundin game  (diagram 9-141)  , by 4.f3 Ra3+ 5.Ke2 Ra2+ 6.Kd1 Ra3 7.a7.

Whites king selects a path to advance which will allow him to execute the interference idea as quickly as possible that is, moving the rook with tempo to the a-file. }

{ Our analysis of the Kantoroich/Steckner position acquaints us with the most important contemporary ideas for playing this endgame with the standard pawn structure f7-g6-h5 versus f2-g3-h4.  Now we proceed to an endgame with a different structure.  Here Black is faced with quite unpleasant problems: even after winning the g3-pawn he cannot activate his king, and creating a passed pawn is difficult, too. In addition, each initial move harms his position in some way, so he has to choose the least of the evils.  An attempt to force the matters loses:   1...Ra2+ ?  2.Ke3  Ra3+  3.Kd4  Rxg3  4.Rc8  Ra3  5.Rc7+  Kf6  6.a7  Ke6  7.Kc5  Ra1  8.Kb6  Rb1+   8...Kd5  9.Rc5+  Ke4  10.Ra5  9.Kc6  Ra1  10.Kb7  Kd5  11.a8=Q  Rxa8  12.Kxa8  Ke4  13.Rg7  Kxf4  14.Rxg6  Ke3  15.Rg5  Obviously, the king should be cut off along the third rank.   1...Kh7 ?!  is also dubious,  as after  2.Ra7+ !  Kh6  3.Ke2  Rxg3  4.Rb7  Ra3  5.a7  the black king is poorly placed on h6.  But with correct defense, Black nevertheless manages to hold. }

{ Let us now look at a few examples from current practice, and make use of our knowledge of theory to determine why strong grandmasters should suffer misfortune in drawn positions. We shall also learn some new ideas, which will enrich our theoretical understanding. In order to do this, however, we shall have to dive again and again into analytical debris.  Tragicomedies: Svidler - Akopian, European Cup, Kallithea 2002  This is the Kantorovich/Steckner position, with the white king slightly less well-placed. In some lines, obviously, Black will have an extra tempo, which enlarges the sphere of drawing possibilities at his disposal. }

{ Hollis - Flórián, ol cr 1972  (analysis)    We come to the most interesting point. The fact the b-pawn is nearer the kingside in comparison with a rooks pawn has its sunny side for Black. He can abandon the idea of a race and apply another, somewhat surprising, strategy: his king is able to prevent the invasion of the enemy king.  The remarkable defensive plan of creating a barrier against the opponents king was suggested many years ago by Vadim Kantorovich. He did not subject his idea to analysis and was not even sure that it would be sufficient to draw. I examined the position, focusing on the piece placement proposed by Kantorovich: with the rook on b7, the king remains on e6, and in reply to the move Rb8, removing the attack on the f7-pawn, Kd6 is played. In the ensuing complicated variations, Black, it seemed to me, has every right to look forward to saving himself.  In 2011, Vardan Pogosyan made some significant theoretical corrections. First of all, he found the subtle road to victory in one of the lines which I had examined. Secondly, he established that Black achieves a draw much more easily than in my lines, if the king occupies d5, something that is both possible and necessary, even with the rook on b7 ! }

{ Hollis - Flórián, ol cr 1972  (analysis)    Speaking about ideas Lets return to the very beginning of this ending.  We now have the right to question the natural move 3... Rb3 ?!. The idea was to tie down the king to the f3-pawn. But since the king is not going to protect it, and since Black, as has become clear, cannot justify capturing it, why waste a tempo withdrawing the rook ? Stefan Bücker correctly noted that there is a relatively simple draw after }

But not   7...Kxf3 ?  8.Kc2  with the threat of transferring the rook to the b-file.  The draw is also still attainable here, but the lines are much more intense. Here is one of them:  8.Kc2  Kf2  9.f4  Rb6  10.Rd2+  Ke1  11.Rd1+  Ke2 !  12.Rb1  Rc6+  and the white king has nowhere to hide from the checks.

{ Of course ! With this structure, Black has a much harder time getting counterplay on the kingside. Additionally, this relatively new situation means that the standard recipes are no longer any good. Black must now create a brand-new defensive method, without knowing if his choice of plan will offer him realistic saving chances or not.  As an example, the international master Julen Arizmendi suggested that Black play   3...h5 !?  4.g5 !  Ra3  here, and presented a tremendously complex analysis, showing that Black draws with exact play. However, at the very end of his main variation, Steckner found an improvement for White, which wins.  You can read all the details in Karsten Müller’s January 2004 article at chesscafe.com. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Common Observations about Endgames with Many Pawns@@HeaderEnd@@   The Rooks Activity    The rooks activity is the main principle for evaluation and practical play in rook-and-pawn endgames.  It can take various forms: attacking the enemys pawns, supporting its own passed pawns, cutting the opponents king off, or pursuing the king.  It also happens that the rook must sometimes behave passively, its functions being limited purely to defense. But in these cases  one should relentlessly seek opportunities to activate the rook, even at cost of pawn sacrifices or a deteriorated kings position.   The following classic ending illustrates this principle excellently. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Akiba Rubinstein's Masterpiece@@HeaderEnd@@  As Tartakower wrote, 'Rubinstein is a rook ending of a chess game that was started by God a thousand years ago.' I want to conclude the chapter on rook-and-pawn endings with an example from the creative work of the outstanding Polish grandmaster. It is rumored that after the game finished  (the final stage of which we shall study)  Rubinsteins respected opponent, grandmaster Spielmann, shouted: 'Akiba, if you lived in the Middle Ages you would have been burned at the stake: what you do in rook endgames can only be called witchcraft !'  Spielmann - Rubinstein, St. Petersburg 1909   A positional disadvantage that occurs often is an abundance of pawn islands.  White has four islands against Blacks two; this means that White has more vulnerable pawns that cannot protect each other. Therefore his position is inferior. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Rook Pawns@@HeaderEnd@@  Positions with rook pawns are quite difficult, even top grandmasters cannot avoid errors when playing them. Nevertheless, knowledge of their basic ideas makes certain practical sense.   J. Enevoldsen, 1949   This is perhaps the most favorable situation for the stronger side. The pawn has crossed the middle line and the black king is in the dangerous corner. White forces ...h7-h6, then drives the black king farther away and cuts it off along a file. Finally White comes back to the pawn with his king and sacrifices his rook for the bishop.   However, there is an important caveat. This plan is only feasible because the black king is cut off on the eighth rank. If the king is on g7, the position is drawn. White cannot force the king to the edge of the board, carry out h5-h6 or force his opponent to play h7-h6. }

{ Salwe - Rubinstein, Prague 1908   Rubinstein carried out the same plan of driving the king off from the pawn that we have seen in the previous example, and was successful with it. However it was later proven that White could have held the position with a precise defense.   Maizelis found the answer to this endgame puzzle in 1963. It turned out that Black should not drive the white king away from the corner. On the contrary, the king should be locked in the corner, with idea of putting Black in zugzwang. Let us study the analysis by Maizelis. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Two Pawns vs. Two on the Same Wing@@HeaderEnd@@  First the most important position that everybody should know.   This is an elementary fortress; White cannot breach the barrier. If the king returns to f4, Black takes g5 under control by means of Bf6. An advance of pawns brings no change.   Why is this position so important ? It is rather simple but delivers plenty of useful information. For example, it tells us what to do when the black pawn stands on h7. Then h7-h5 ! is essential, while White, when he is on move, should prevent this advance by means of g3-g4 !. Moreover, the evaluation of the diagrammed position extends automatically to a number of related situations that occur after a pawn exchange on g4, when Black remains with a g6-pawn against Whites g- or h-pawn. The position with the white g5- and h4-pawns against Blacks g6- and h5-pawns is also drawn.   The only possible attempt to set problems for Black, a rook transfer to the g-file after an exchange of pawns  (g3 against h5)  , can be parried by correct defense. }

{ Now we come to those exceptionally complicated cases when the king of the weaker side is placed far away from the pawn. Computers have proved that a win, when it exists, can often be achieved  (when both sides play correctly)  only after more than 50 moves ! Practical players should not delve too deeply into this jungle, for these endings occur quite seldom. We shall confine ourselves to basic theoretical statements and the most important practical methods.

{ The stronger side should place the king on the same file or rank where the defenders king is standing, or an adjacent file or rank  (this rule is also valid when more pawns are present on the board)  .   This tactic often enables counter-checks when the queen provides protection from a defenders check by interference.

Qe2+  78.Kf4  Qd2+  79.Ke5  Qb2+  80.Kd6  Qb8+  81.Ke7  Qb4+  82.Kf7  Qb7+  83.Kf6  Qb6+  84. -Qe6  (this is only an introduction: a lot of precise moves are still required for achieving success)  .  But why is the move actually played wrong ? Because,  when dealing with a knight or rook pawn, the defender's king is best placed near the corner that is diametrically opposite to the pawn promotion square. Then, when the stronger side defends his king from checks with a queen interference, a counter-check is less probable.    Black could have played 77... Ka3 ! here and theory says that it is a draw, although it is a long way from a theoretical evaluation to a half-point in the tournament table, because these positions are very difficult to defend.  We should add that  the indicated drawing zone does not exist in case of a bishop or central pawn.  One can only expect that the opponents play will not be precise  (although defenders errors are more probable in these situations)  or ... that the king manages to reach the area in front of the pawn like in the Botvinnik-Tal endgame.   By the way,  the drawing zone, near the pawn, is considerably larger with a rook pawn, compared with other pawns, because the defender can go for a queen exchange much more often.    Having arrived at general considerations about various pawn cases, I add two more remarks:   A. The farther the pawn is advanced, the less the defenders chance for a draw;   B. The closer the pawn is to the edge of the board, the greater the drawing chances. With central and bishop pawns, practically all positions with a remote king are lost. With a knight pawn, winning positions occur very often. With a rook pawn, a draw can be reached in a majority of positions, although the defense is not simple. }
1... Ka5
{ The wrong way ! But this choice was not made purely by chance. The above-mentioned game Botvinnik-Ravinsky had been thoroughly annotated by Keres, and the Estonian grandmaster erroneously suggested keeping the king on a5 and a4. }
2. Qd2+ Ka4 3. Qd4+ Ka5 4. Kg5
{ Take notice of Whites last moves.  The queen is placed best on the central squares  (this is usually valid for the defenders queen as well)  . The closer the queen is to the edge of the board, the winning process is more difficult and the probability of a perpetual check is higher.   By the way, now we can easily explain why Botvinnik's 74 Qf6 was less accurate than 74 Kf5 !. His queen should not leave the center unless it is an emergency. }
4... Qe7+ 5. Kf5 Qf8+ 6. Ke4 Qh6 7. Qe5+ Ka4 8. g7
{ Finally the pawn succeeds in moving forward, and the finale is near. The finish is also very instructive: White approaches the black king with his monarch in order to create a situation when every check can be met with a counter-check. This method  ( king-to-king )  is characteristic for queen-and-pawn endings. }

Only a detailed analysis can tell us who comes first in implementing his plans. In Averbakhs opinion, only   4...Qb4 !  5.Qd5+  Kg7  6.Qe5+  Kh7  7.f4  a4  8.h5  a3  9.Qf5+  Kg7  10.Qg6+  Kh8  11.Qf6+  Kg8 !  was good enough for a draw, while the natural-looking move from the game was erroneous. }

{ Euwe - Reshevsky, Nottingham 1936  In this sort of position, White's standard plan is to place his queen on a8 and then to push the a-pawn to the promotion square. The queen not only supports the pawn advance; it also protects the king from checks along the main diagonal. The only constructive idea for the weaker side is to achieve a perpetual check; to this end, he must destroy the position of the white king. }

Black could achieve success by means of a king invasion to support his pawn, but this is not easy to do. Let us study a few of possible attempts.   47...e3 ?!  is harmless in view of  48.Qe4 ! =  or 48 Qc7 ! =.  The try to activate the king immediately by   47...Ke5 ?!  is tempting.

{ @@HeaderStart@@An Active Queen@@HeaderEnd@@  The queen is a very mobile piece that can rapidly reach any part of the board. Therefore a more active position of the queen  (compared with the opponent's queen)  is usually only a temporary advantage which should be exploited immediately. But this advantage can be lasting, too: such is the case when the enemy's queen is chained to its own weak pawns.   This advantage is particularly tangible when the opponent's king is exposed. The stronger sides resources are dramatically rich in such cases: from a queen transfer  (with checks)  to a more favorable position or a double attack, to a queen exchange and even a mating attack. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Queen versus Rook@@HeaderEnd@@ A Solitary Rook The side that has a rook will try, except in very rare cases, to build a fortress. We shall study the most important theoretical positions here, both drawn and winning. Sometimes one must play dozens of precise moves in a row in order to destroy the opponents line of defense. However, the winning plans that we should know are mostly standard, even when they are quite complicated tactically. Master Khenkin has greatly contributed to the theory of this sort of endgame; he wrote the corresponding section for Averbakhs endgame treatise and, for this purpose, analyzed a huge number of new positions. }

The methods in this elementary example  ( zugzwang, triangulation as a tool for passing the obligation to move, and double attack )  are standard for almost all queen-versus-rook endings, with or without pawns. If the defender's king is standing in the center, the stronger side gradually drives him to the edge of the board to create mating threats. However, this mission is not elementary, since the rook may sometimes be placed far away from the king without fear of being lost immediately. }

{ Under time controls that are characteristic for modern chess, queen-versus-rook endings usually occur when the both sides are suffering from time shortage. For example, grandmaster Svidler, playing against Gelfand at the 2001 world championship in Moscow, had a few minutes  (plus an additional 10 seconds after every move)  and failed to outplay his opponent over 50 moves; thereafter the arbiters duly declared a draw.  In order to avoid such an unpleasant occurrence, one can practice with a computer program; it defends against the queen in a most tenacious way.  The study of the following position is based upon computer-generated lines that indicate the best moves for both sides  (of course, these are not the only moves one can play)  . Naturally, there is no sense in remembering these lines by heart; typical ideas behind the moves are much more important. }

{ V. Khenkin, 1966  As we know, a similar position, without the g6-pawn, is drawn. But here, when this pawn deprives the rook of the second protected square, White wins: he gradually approaches the black pawn with his king using the zugzwang technique.  It is worth mentioning that White is helpless in making any progress if his king is cut off in the right corner, be it in the diagrammed position or in many similar situations. }

However, my experience as a chess trainer finally put an end to these doubts because I have seen how many chessplayers, including very strong ones, either missed learning this technique at an appropriate time or had already forgotten it.  Therefore they risk presenting their opponents with a half-point  (and this has happened more than once)  , particularly under modern time controls when checkmating must often be performed in severe time trouble. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Checkmating with Two Knights@@HeaderEnd@@  Driving the king to the edge of the board is an easy task. Alas, you can only stalemate it thereafter, not checkmate, but three knights will win against a single knight.   However  if the defender has a pawn, and this pawn is not too advanced, and it is blocked with one of the knights, an eventual win is quite possible,  although the winning process is very difficult; it may require dozens of precise moves.   As the Russian study composer Troitsky proved in the beginning of the 20th century, a knight together with a king can drive the solitary king either to a corner or towards the spare knight  (the one that is blocking the pawn)  . Thereafter, the spare knight joins the hunt, and mate is delivered with its help. }

{ Mark Tseitlin - Finkel, Beersheba 1996   In this position, the characteristic difference  (in comparison with those we have seen previously)  is the position of the black h-pawn here it is far less favorable. First, Black does not have the familiar plan with g6-g5-g4 followed by a transition to a pawn endgame. Second, in case of an exchange of rooks, White will be able to exchange a pair of pawns without any problem, and Blacks remaining h-pawn will be quite useless against the king in the safe corner h1.

{ @@HeaderStart@@An Extra Bishop or Knight with Queens or Minor Pieces@@HeaderEnd@@  Let us first discuss positions without pawns.  A bishop and a knight can win against a knight only in exceptional cases, and all the more so against a bishop.  But two bishops can practically always cope with a knight.  Kling and Horwitz  (1851)  thought that this position was drawn. As a matter of fact, the knight is quite favorably placed on b7 for defensive purposes. Only in 1983 did computer analysis show that this defensive setup could be destroyed without permitting its restoration in another corner. If both sides play this endgame perfectly, the winning process lasts more than 50 moves; it is too complicated to reproduce it here.  A queen and a minor piece cannot, generally speaking, win against a queen. But exceptions are not so rare with this material: an attack against the king can lead to mate or to a win of the queen.  From the wide variety of positions with pawns, I would like to distinguish those with bishops of opposite colors. It turns out that the drawish tendencies typical in pure cases of such bishops  (i.e., with bishops of opposite color and no other pieces)  , are valid here too, helping the weaker side to survive even when a piece down. Two examples of this sort follow. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Rook vs. Two Minor Pieces@@HeaderEnd@@  In the middlegame, two minor pieces are usually much stronger than a rook. In an endgame this advantage is much less significant; sometimes a rook can even gain the upper hand. The reason is that pawn chains in the middlegame restrict the rooks mobility. In an endgame, on the contrary, the rook enjoys full mobility.  A rook is especially dangerous when it attacks pawns  (usually placed along the seventh rank)  that cannot be protected by the king and cannot be defended comfortably with the pieces; another case of a dangerous rook is when it supports a distant passed pawn. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Queen vs. Various Pieces@@HeaderEnd@@  A rook and a bishop or a rook and a knight  (without pawns)  draw easily against a queen if, of course, they are not so disunited that the opponent can rapidly win one of pieces.  Two knights can resist a queen successfully. They are best placed on squares adjacent to the king. Two bishops, curiously enough, are almost never able to draw against a queen, although the winning process is often complicated and requires many dozens of moves.  The only drawing position was discovered as early as the 18th century. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@General Endgame Ideas@@HeaderEnd@@  Along with the many techniques that apply to specific material relationships, this book also deals with more general principles and methods of playing the endgame which are used in a wide variety of circumstances. In this chapter we will reiterate the most important endgame ideas, and refine our impressions of them here and there.   "There are three things that give the endgame its characteristic features: the active power of the king, the passed pawn and the need to make a move, changing the dynamic on the board, the so-called zugzwang," wrote Emanuel Lasker in Common Sense in Chess  (Russian edition, 1924)  .  Having studied the preceding chapters, I hope you are now convinced that skillful endgame play does not merely consist of automatically following some prescribed formula of dry and dull rules. In endgames, just as in other stages of the struggle, complex variations must be calculated and beautiful hidden combinations must be discovered. Theory only aids our search for the proper solution. Some of the practical endgames and studies that we have examined are by no means aesthetically inferior to the finest creative examples from the opening and middlegame.  Here I would like to acquaint the readers with some new and spectacular examples that were not included earlier. Thus, this chapter is devoted not only to endgame strategy, but also to endgame tactics, especially in the exercises at the end of each section. }

{ Sometimes the route for a kings march should be prepared by means of pawn exchanges. This technique is called  'widening the beachhead.'   A. Yusupov, 1995  White has two active possibilities:   A. To create a distant passed pawn by means of f2-f4, g4-g5, and f4xg5; and   B. to widen the beachhead: the move g4-g5 is made when the f-pawn is still on f2, then the king goes to the e-pawn and, eventually, to the queenside.  However both these plans fail if started immediately:   1.f4 ?

{ This example demonstrates how dangerous  connected passed pawns  can be. In many endings, a  distant passed pawn  can be also very important. Fighting against it can be a difficult matter, and even if one succeeds in stopping it, one often loses control of events on the opposite wing.

{ @@HeaderStart@@Zugzwang@@HeaderEnd@@  Zugzwang is a situation in which each possible move worsens one's position.  Zugzwang is one of the most important endgame tools. It is applicable everywhere: in elementary endgames such as king and pawn versus king or king and rook versus king  (in the latter case, the checkmating process cannot be successful without a zugzwang technique)  , as well as in the most complicated situations which require deep and precise calculation, where the pros and cons of every move may not be quite evident.  Zugzwang is very often reciprocal; both sides try to come to a certain position with the opponent on move.  Squares of the reciprocal zugzwang are called corresponding squares.   The simplest cases of corresponding squares are:  opposition   (a correspondence of kings on a file, or rank, or sometimes a diagonal;  mined squares )  (a pair of corresponding squares)  (; triangle a maneuver with the purpose ceding the move to the opponent.  In creating and handling zugzwang situations,  spare tempi  can be vitally important. To this end, it is often useful to keep pawns on their initial positions, in order to have a choice between moving one or two squares when a critical situation arises)  ( the Steinitz rule )  (.  All this is undoubtedly well-known to you from the previous chapters. Here we will only take some practical exercise with these ideas.  Zugzwang, whether it has already occurred or can occur soon, is not always evident. Therefore, when seeking a way to your objective, you should  remember to ask yourselves: how would your opponent play if he were on move ?  This question should be addressed not only to the actual position, but also to positions that arise in calculated lines.) }

{ @@HeaderStart@@A Fortified Camp@@HeaderEnd@@  We define this as a situation in which a king, with or without the assistance of pieces or pawns, successfully defends a small territory  (as a rule, in a corner)  and cannot be ousted. Almost all the theoretical fortresses that are already known to you belong in this category. I add only a single, more complicated example here.  F. Simkhovich, 1926  The h3-pawn will inevitably be promoted. Whites only chance for a successful defense consists in building a fortress: f5-f6 and Kf8-g7. But to build a reliable fortress he needs to place his bishop on h6. Otherwise Black brings his king to f5, takes the knight with his queen and captures the g5-pawn, winning. The question is whether White can perform this task in time.  The natural   1.f6 ?  loses:  h2  2.Kf8  h1=Q  3.Kg7   3.Kg8  Kd7  4.Bf8  Qa8 !  ∆ ...Ke6-f5 +-  3...Kc6  4.Nf8  Qh4  5.Nh7  Kd5  6.Ba3  Ke4  7.Bb4  Kf5  8.Bd2  Qf2  9.Bc1  Qe1  10.Ba3  Qh1  -+  followed by 11...

{ @@HeaderStart@@A Pawn Barrier@@HeaderEnd@@  Even a huge material advantage sometimes cannot be exploited when a pawn barrier lies across the chessboard. A king  (or, as it may happen in exceptional cases, a king and other pieces)  cannot overcome the barrier, and therefore there is no win.  We saw this situation in the exercise 7/15  (in the chapter on bishop versus knight)  , in the annotation to 4 Kb3 !. The alternative possibility led to the win of a piece and to ... an obvious draw caused by erecting a pawn barrier that the king could not breach.  The following curious example is taken from a game between two leading chessplayers of their time.  Chigorin - Tarrasch, Vienna 1898  Chigorin offered a draw, and Tarrasch unexpectedly rejected this offer. Then Chigorin took his bishop away from the board and suggested his opponent to try to win with an extra piece. Tarrasch immediately accepted the draw proposal. Actually, his king cannot invade Whites position, while his bishop alone cannot accomplish anything. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Checkmate@@HeaderEnd@@  The aim of chess is checkmate. But a mating net can hardly be made when only a few pieces remain on the board. First one should obtain a considerable advantage by means of a pawn promotion. Therefore, as has been mentioned already, creation and advance of passed pawns is the main theme of endgames.  However king attacks are possible in endgames, too. They happen relatively seldom but are almost always sudden, because our thoughts are occupied with other topics and mate threats can be easily overlooked. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Domination@@HeaderEnd@@  We use the word "domination" to name the technique that involves trapping an enemy piece by taking control of all of its flight squares. This method is not only applicable in endgames. Botvinnik was of the opinion that clever play for domination, in all stages of the game, is a characteristic feature of the chess style of the 12th World Champion Anatoly Karpov.  Domination can be implemented in many ways. One can catch and eliminate an enemy piece or simply deprive it of all moves. Sometimes one can just make important squares inaccessible to certain pieces in order to prevent their interference in the main events on the board.  Please visualize some endgames with an extra exchange: catching a lonely knight when it is separated from its king, or a win with a rook versus a bishop when a king is in a dangerous corner, or the Elkies position  (diagram 11-24)  .  Perhaps a knight is caught the most often because it is the least mobile piece. }
