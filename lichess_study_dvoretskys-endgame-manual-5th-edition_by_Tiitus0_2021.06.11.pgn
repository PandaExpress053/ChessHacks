{ Triangulation refers to a king maneuver which aims to lose a tempo, and leave the opponent with the move.

The d5- and d7-squares are in correspondence. The mobility of black's king is restricted: he must watch for the c5-c6 break, and also avoid being pressed to the edge of the board. It is not surprising, therefore , that white can easily "lose" a tempo and place his opponent in zugzwang. }

{ The kings were on d5 and c8 here; but we shall not place them on the board just yet - let's deal with the squares of correspondence first.
Two pairs of squares of reciprocal zugzwang are obvious right off, d6/d8 and c5/c7. The squares d6 and c5 border on d5; and for black, the corresponding squares d8 and c7 border on c8. Thus, a standard means of identifying new correspondence: that of the d5- and c8-squares.
Along with d5 and c5, white has two equally important squares: c4 and d4. Black also has two corresponding squares, b8 and d8, but the are not connected, while c4 and d4 are.

{ During a training session I found another solution to this study, based on a completely different logic.
The d5-square is key here (with white's king at d5 and black's at d7, white wins by h4-h5). By the way, with the pawn already on h5, occupying the d5 square is no longer decisive: the key squares are now on the sixth rank - c6, d6 and e6. Which leads us to an important conclusion: when the pawn structure changes, the system of key squares associated with the position generally changes too, just as with the system of corresponding squares.
With white's king at f4, black must deal with the threat of g4-g5. It can be parried by putting the black king on e7 (but not on f7, because white's king will occupy the key square d5) - which immediately gives us two pairs of corresponding squares: f4/e7 and e4/d6. Next to these, white has two equivalent squares: f3 and e3. Black meanwhile has only one - d7. Thus, the winning mechanism becomes clear - triangulation! } { [%csl Ge7,Gf4,Re4,Rd6] }

{ There are cases when a king must battle with two seperated passed pawns; in these cases, a useful rule is the floating-square rule, suggested by Studenecki in 1939.
If a square whose two corners are occupied by pawns (on the same rank) reaches the edge of the board, then one of those pawns must queen. (Unless one can be captured right away.) If the square does not reach the edge of the board, then the king can hold the pawns. If there are two files between the pawns the king can capture both; if the distance is any greater, he can only prevent their further advance. (The cases where there is only one file between the pawns will be looked at later.)

The square having reached the edge of the board, the pawns will queen, regardless of whose move it is. } { [%cal Ga5a1,Ga1e1,Ge1e5,Ge5a5] }

{ The queen generally wins against either a center or knight pawn.

The algorithm is simple: the queen uses checks or attacks on the pawn to get closer to the enemy king and drive it to the d1-square. This gives white's king a tempo to get closer to the pawn. This procedure is repeated as often as necessary. }

{ The main key squares are c4, d4, e4, e5, e6 and e7. Black can protect them, if he can control the opposition when the enemy king approaches.
Let's determine the corresponding squares. With white's king at d3, f3 or h3, black's king must occupy d5; the e3- and g3-squares correspond to e5. When the king advances further, black must keep the lateral opposition, maneuvering alomn the e- and the d-files.
When white's king is on the second rank, black's king must stay next to the d5- and e5-squares - specifically, on d6 or e6. So the first move - as well as all the play that follows - becomes clear: } { [%csl Rh3,Rf3,Rd3,Rd5,Be3,Be5,Bg3][%cal Ga4e8,Ge8e4,Ge4a4,Ga4a8,Ga8e8] }

{ In chess literature this position is usually referred to as "The Lucena Position" even though the Spaniard Lucena did not examine it in his book published in 1497. The first mention of an analogous position was in the book by Salvio (1634), which referred to Scipione of Genoa.
If white is on move he wins. }

Usually the lucena position is given with black's rook on d2. Then building a bridge wins by 1. Rg1+ Kh7 2.Rg4, as does bringing the rook to d1 with 2.Ra1. } *

1... Ra8+ 2. Kc7 Ra7+ 3. Kc8 Ra8+ 4. Kb7 { Hence we can conclude:
(1) If the pawn is on the seventh rank, multiple winning methods exist. The most important ones are building a bridge for protection from checks along files and a rook maneuver for protection from side checks along ranks. If the attacker has a knight pawn, then only building a bridge wins.
(2) When the king of the weaker side is cut off from the pawn, the only defensive technique consists in side checks.
(3) A rook pursuit of the enemy king can only be succesful when the rook and the pawn are seperated at minimum by three lines. As we shall see later, this rule does not only apply to side checks.
(4) A central or a bishop pawn divides the chessboard into two unequal parts: one is "long," another is "short." The correct positioning of forces for the weaker side is to keep the king on tthe short side, and the rook on the long side. } *

{ First let's examine the situation when the king of the weaker side is in front of the pawn.

Black's rook must remain passive, staying on the eighth rank. White wins easily by bringing his rook to h7. }
