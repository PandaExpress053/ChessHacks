{ This study is based on the book "The Complete Endgame Course" by Jeremy Silman.

"All chess players need endgame skills, but doing the work to achieve this much-needed knowledge is anything but easy. My goal in writing this book was to take a subject that most see as boring and make it palatable, educational, and yes, even fun."
- Jeremy Silman

This study contains endgames for all ratings starting from new to chess, and gradually moving to more advanced endgames. }

{ The easiest way to deliver checkmate when you are up by two major pieces (queen or rook) is to force the enemy king to one side of the board using a concept known as the staircase. } { [%csl Gf5][%cal Gf2f5,Gf5a5,Gf5h5] }

Same concepts apply with two rooks(or two queens). } *
